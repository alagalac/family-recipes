title: Cheese Scones
prep_time: 10 minutes
cook_time: 15-20 minutes
servings: 13 scones
ingredients:
  - 540g Flour
  - 25g (5 Â½ tsp) Baking Powder
  - 9.2g (2 tsp) Sugar
  - 5g Salt
  - 1.9g Cayenne Pepper
  - 435g Tasty Cheese
  - 360g Milk
instructions:
  - Put all the dry ingredients into a large bowl, including the cheese.
  - Create a well in the dry ingredients and pour the milk and butter in. Combine mixture (remember to fold it in) but do not over work it.
  - Wet your hands and roll into good even sized balls which can be weighed if desired or done by sight. The most important thing to remember is to be light with the rolling, quick with hands and even in size.
  - Once the mix is combined, place the rolled balls onto an oven tray lined with baking paper and top the scones with more grated cheese.
  - Bake at 180 degrees celsius for 15-20 mins or until golden in colour.
  - Let scones rest for five minutes before serving.
notes:
  - Make sure your hands are wet when rolling the scones. Run your hands under the tap every second scone.
  - Pre-grated Tasty cheese works well for this recipe.
  - When trying to tell if they are done or not, base your decision more on the colour of the scones rather than the time that they've been in the oven.
  - If in doubt, add more cheese.
  - Smoked paprika can be used instead of cayenne pepper for a different flavour.
  - Chopped herbs can be added for extra flavour, such as parsley or chives.
