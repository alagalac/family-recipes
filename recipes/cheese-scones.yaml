title: Cheese Scones
prep_time: 10 minutes
cook_time: 15-20 minutes
servings: 13 scones
ingredients:
  - 540g Flour
  - 25g (5 ½ tsp) Baking Powder
  - 9.2g (2 tsp) Sugar
  - 5g Salt
  - 1.9g Cayenne Pepper
  - 435g Tasty Cheese
  - 360g Milk
instructions:
  - Put all the dry ingredients into a large bowl, including the cheese and mix well.
  - Create a well in the dry ingredients and pour the milk in. Combine mixture with a knife (remember to fold it in) but do not over work it.
  - Wet your hands and roll into good even sized balls which can be weighed if desired or done by sight. The most important thing to remember is to be light with the rolling, quick with hands and even in size.
  - Once the mix is combined, place the rolled balls onto an oven tray lined with baking paper and top the scones with more grated cheese.
  - Bake at 220°C for 10-15 mins or until golden in colour.
  - Let scones rest for five minutes before serving.
notes:
  - Make sure your hands are wet when rolling the scones. Run your hands under the tap every second scone.
  - Tasty cheese works well for this recipe, but you can also use up any cheese you have on hand.
  - Unlikely many recipes, this recipe actually works best if you use pre-grated cheese.
  - Smoked paprika can be used instead of cayenne pepper.
  - Chopped herbs can be added for extra flavour, such as parsley or chives.

commentary: 'When we lived in London I felt homesick for cheese scones, so I researched all of the Wellington cheese scone recipes that I could find. This recipe is the result of that research and combining the best bits of each.'
