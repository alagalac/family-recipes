prep_time: "25 minutes"
cook_time: "20-30 minutes"
servings: "5"
ingredients:
  - "Meatloaves:"
  - 1 brown onion
  - 1 carrot
  - 1 parsnip
  - 450g beef and pork mince
  - 1 egg
  - 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
  - 1 Tbsp gluten-free soy sauce
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 2 Tbsp chopped parsley
  - 1/4 cup tomato sauce
  - 1 cup grated cheese
  - ""
  - "Mash:"
  - 600g potatoes
  - 1 carrot
  - 1 Tbsp butter
  - 1/4 cup milk
  - 1 Tbsp finely chopped chives
  - 1/4 tsp salt
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 220Â°C. Grease a 12-hole muffin tin (or loaf tin measuring about 25cm x 16cm). Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Bring a full kettle to the boil. Finely dice onion; grate carrot; peel and grate parsnip.
  - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large fry-pan on medium heat. Fry onion, carrot and parsnip about 4 minutes, until tender.
  - In a large bowl, combine mince, egg, breadcrumbs, soy sauce, salt, parsley, half the tomato sauce and half the cheese. Season with pepper.
  - Add cooked vegetables to the bowl with mince mixture. Mix well, using clean hands. Press about 1/4 cup of mixture into the muffin tins. Pack mixture into muffin or loaf tin tightly, so it stays together once baked. Top with remaining tomato sauce and cheese. Bake for 20 minutes (muffin tins) or 30 minutes (loaf tin).
  - While meatloaves cook, cut potatoes and carrot into 2cm pieces. Cook in pot of boiling water, for about 12-15 minutes, until very soft. Mash with butter, milk, chives and salt, until smooth. Cover, to keep warm.
  - Set cooked meatloaves aside, to rest for 5 minutes.
notes:
  - Serve with a side of steamed vegetables such as broccoli for a complete meal.
  - Alternatively just do normal mash potatoes with a bit of wholegrain mustard.
