prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "30 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 400g paneer, 1.5cm cubes
  - 150g baby spinach leaves
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 1 tin (400g) chopped tomatoes
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tbsp ginger, minced
  - 2 tsp garam masala
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric
  - 1 tin (400ml) coconut cream (or use 1 cup cream)
  - 2 carrots, grated
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 1/2 cups basmati rice
  - Naan bread, to serve
instructions:
  - Cook the basmati rice according to the package instructions.
  - Cut the paneer into 1.5cm cubes.
  - Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the paneer cubes and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
  - In the same pan, add more oil if needed, then cook the diced onion and grated carrots until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
  - Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.
  - Stir in the garam masala and turmeric, and cook for 1 minute.
  - Add the chopped tomatoes and coconut cream. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.
  - Add the baby spinach leaves and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes.
  - Blend with an immersion blender until smooth (optional). Season with salt to taste.
  - Return the paneer to the pan and simmer for another 5 minutes to heat through.
  - Serve the palak paneer curry over the cooked basmati rice with naan bread on the side.
notes:
  - For a non-vegetarian option you could use chicken thigh instead of paneer.
commentary: "This isn't a traditional palak paneer recipe, but it's what the kids like! The grated carrots help to bulk it out and sweeten the sauce."
