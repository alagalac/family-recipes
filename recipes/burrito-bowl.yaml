ingredients:
  - 1 cup rice (white or brown)
  - 1 cup corn (fresh, canned, or frozen)
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 1 red pepper, diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 can crushed tomatoes
  - 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
  - 1 tbsp mexican spice mix (or chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano)
  - 2 avocados, sliced
  - 200g cherry tomatoes, halved
  - 1/2 cup shredded lettuce
  - 1/4 cup chopped coriander
  - 1/4 cup grated cheese
  - 1/4 cup sour cream
  - 1 lime, juiced
  - Corn chips, for serving
instructions:
  - Cook rice according to package instructions.
  - Heat drizzle of oil in a pan over medium heat. Add corn, cooking until tender (about 5-7 minutes).
  - Transfer corn to a bowl and add coriander, a pinch of salt, pepper, and lime juice. Mix well and set aside.
  - In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed and saut√© onion and red pepper until softened (about 5-7 minutes). Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
  - Add crushed tomatoes and spices, stir, then add black beans to the pan and cook until heated through (about 3-5 minutes). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - To serve, divide rice between bowls. Top with the tomato and bean mixture, corn, avocado slices, cherry tomatoes, shredded lettuce, coriander, cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and corn chips for crunch.
notes:
  - You can add beef or chicken mince to the tomato and bean mixture if you want a non-vege option.
  - Feel free to change the toppings and use whatever you have. Omit whatever isn't in season or is too expensive.
  - Mixing chipotle sauce into the sour cream works really well.
  - Don't forget the corn chips. The Mexicano brand ones are the best!
