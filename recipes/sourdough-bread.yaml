title: Sourdough Bread
prep_time: Overnight + 6 hours
cook_time: 25 minutes
servings: 1 loaf
ingredients:
  - Starter
  - 100g Wholemeal flour
  - 400g High grade flour
  - 15g Salt
  - 350ml Water (first measure)
  - 25ml Water (second measure)
  - 1 tsp Olive oil
instructions:
  - If storing starter in fridge, remove from fridge and leave at room temperature overnight to allow to bubble up.
  - Feed starter, and add excess starter to mixing bowl.
  - Add both flour measures and salt to mixing bowl and add first measure of 350ml water. Mix well then allow to rest for at least 10 minutes.
  - Add second measure of 25ml water and fold dough in bowl. It should have a slightly slimy feel.
  - Every couple of hours in the mixing bowl fold the dough over itself from all four corners. Do this until the dough had puffed up a bit. The time this takes will vary depending on the ambient temperature.
  - Oil a bread pan with olive oil and then turn dough out into the pan. Allow to rise until it's about at the top of the pan.
  - Bake in the oven at 200 fan-forced for 25 minutes. When finished turn out onto a rack for bread to cool. Don't leave it in the pan or it will get soggy.
