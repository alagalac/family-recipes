title: "Dumplings"
prep_time: "45 minutes"
cook_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "4 servings (about 50 dumplings)"
ingredients:
  - 400g pork mince
  - 1 cup finely chopped cabbage
  - 1 carrot, grated
  - 1 tsp grated ginger
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 2 packs dumpling wrappers (about 50 wrappers)
  - Water for sealing dumplings
  - Sweet chili sauce or soy sauce for serving
instructions:
  - In a large bowl, combine the pork mince, cabbage, carrot, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix well.
  - Place a small spoonful of the filling onto the center of each dumpling wrapper. Moisten the edges with water, fold the wrapper over the filling, and pinch to seal pleating the edge in the process to make a half-moon.
  - Heat oil in large frying pan over medium heat. Add dumplings in batches, turn them twice so that they are golden brown on all sides.
  - Serve hot with sweet chili sauce or soy sauce to dip in.
notes:
  - You can boil the dumplings instead, but I prefer frying them.
  - I also like to mix soy sauce and vinegar for dipping sauce.
commentary: "I was taught how to make and fold dumplings by a friend who was taught by her parents as a kid. It's a useful life skill!"
