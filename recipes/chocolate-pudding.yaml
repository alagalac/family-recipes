title: Self-saucing Chocolate Pudding
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 35 minutes
servings: 4
ingredients:
  Pudding:
    - 1 cup self raising flour (150g)
    - 3 Tbsp cocoa powder
    - ½ cup brown sugar (100g)
    - 80g butter, melted and cooled
    - ½ cup milk (125ml)
    - 1 egg, lightly beaten
    - Vanilla ice cream or cream, to serve
  Sauce:
    - ¾ cup brown sugar (150g)
    - 2 Tbsp cocoa powder, sifted
    - 1 ¼ cups boiling water (313ml)
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C bake (160°C fan-forced). Grease a 6-cup capacity ovenproof baking dish.
  - Sift self raising flour and cocoa into a large bowl. Stir in the brown sugar.
  - Whisk butter, milk and egg in a jug. Slowly add to flour mixture, stirring until well combined and smooth. Spoon into baking dish and smooth the top.
  - For the sauce combine the brown sugar and cocoa and sprinkle over the pudding. Slowly pour the boiling water over the back of a large metal spoon to cover pudding. Place dish onto a baking tray and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until pudding bounces back when pressed gently in the centre.
  - Serve hot with vanilla ice cream or cream.
notes:
  - A dry self saucing pudding usually means it was overbaked or didn't have enough boiling water added. To keep it saucy, measure liquids carefully and bake until the sponge is just set. Don't overcook!
  - You can prepare the batter and topping ahead of time, but it's best to bake self saucing pudding just before serving. Add the hot water and bake fresh so the sauce stays warm and gooey.

commentary: Growing up, Aunty Barbara's self-saucing chocolate pudding was a family favourite. This recipe is very similar, but with less sugar and more cocoa powder!
