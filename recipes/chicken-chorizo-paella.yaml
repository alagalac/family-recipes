title: "Chicken Chroizo Paella"
prep_time: "20 minutes"
cook_time: "20 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 2 red peppers
  - 1 yellow pepper
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 1 small bunch flat leaf parsley
  - 1 punnet cherry tomatoes
  - 5 chicken thighs (boneless, skinless)
  - 1 chicken stock pot
  - 4 sprigs rosemary
  - 2 diced chorizo sausages (about 150g)
  - 350g basmati rice
  - 1 lemon
  - 600ml boiling water
  - Olive oil
  - Salt and pepper
instructions:
  - Remove the stalks and cores from the peppers and cut into thin slices. Peel and grate the garlic, finely chop the parsley leaves, and quarter the cherry tomatoes. Chop the chicken thighs into bite-sized chunks. Dissolve the chicken stock pot in 600ml boiling water. Pull the rosemary leaves from their sprigs.
  - Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan on high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the pan and fry for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.
  - Add another splash of olive oil to the pan. Add the peppers and tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the garlic, rosemary leaves, and chorizo. Cook for 3 minutes.
  - Add the rice and half of the parsley. Cook for a few minutes until the rice absorbs the oil.
  - Add the chicken stock and browned chicken. Stir well. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15-20 minutes. Do not stir while cooking to allow a crust to form on the bottom.
  - Once the liquid is absorbed, remove the pan from the heat. Cover with a clean tea towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve garnished with the remaining parsley and lemon wedges.
