title: British Pancakes
prep_time: 25 minutes
cook_time: 15 minutes
servings: 8 pancakes
ingredients:
  - 125g plain flour
  - Pinch of salt
  - 1 medium egg
  - 300ml milk
  - Oil or butter to fry
instructions:
  - Sift the flour and salt, make a well in the middle and whisk in the egg. Whisk in the milk, then leave to stand for 20 minutes.
  - Heat a pan and coat lightly with oil or butter. Add a ladleful of batter and tilt the pan to coat thinly.
  - Fry pancake for 1Â½-2 minutes until golden, carefully turning once.
notes: |
  Rest pancake batter for 20 minutes and you'll get a lighter pancake.
  Always weigh out your ingredients. Too much flour and not enough milk will result in a dense pancake.
  When frying, use an equal mix of butter and oil - using just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. The butter helps with flavour and the oil stops the butter from burning.
  Flip your pancake when the edges look set and dry.
  And only flip your pancake once - otherwise it will be tough.
  Don't worry if the first pancake doesn't come out right - use it to test the temperature of the pan and adjust accordingly.

commentary: 'These are the pancakes which I grew up with. Mum would occasionally make them as a weekend treat. However, Kimmie grew up with the more fluffier style pancakes. We had a long dispute over what constitues a pancake, so we settled for calling one style British and the other style American.'
