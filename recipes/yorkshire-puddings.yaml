title: "Yorkshire Puddings"
prep_time: "35 minutes (including resting)"
cook_time: "15-25 minutes"
servings: "12 standard muffin sized puddings"
ingredients:
  - "4 large eggs"
  - "150g all-purpose flour"
  - "175g whole milk"
  - "25g water"
  - "2g kosher salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)"
  - "100ml beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil"
instructions:
  - "Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For best results, refrigerate batter overnight or up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while preheating oven."
  - "Adjust oven rack to centre position and preheat oven to 230Â°C. Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins, one 12-well standard muffin tin, or one 24-well mini muffin tin. Preheat in oven until fat is smoking hot, about 10 minutes."
  - "Transfer pans or tins to a heat-proof surface and divide batter evenly between every well (or between pans if using pans). Wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (or 1/4 for pans). Immediately return to oven. Bake until puddings have quadrupled in volume, are deep brown, crisp, and sound hollow when tapped. Smaller ones take about 15 minutes, popover/skillet-sized about 25 minutes."
  - "Serve immediately."
notes:
  - "Resting the batter overnight improves results."
  - "Can use beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil."
  - "For best rise, ensure fat is smoking hot before adding batter."
commentary: "Classic British side, crisp and hollow, perfect for roast dinners."
