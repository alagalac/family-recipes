title: "Beef Burgers"
prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "10 minutes"
servings: "4 burgers"
ingredients:
  - "500g beef mince"
  - "1 tsp salt"
  - "1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs (optional, for binding)"
  - "1 tbsp leafy herbs (parsley, coriander, thyme etc.)"
  - "4 burger buns"
  - "burger toppings (lettuce, tomato, cheese, sliced beetroot, sauce etc.)"
instructions:
  - "In a bowl, combine the beef mince, salt, breadcrumbs, and herbs. Mix well."
  - "Form the mixture into 4 patties. Push down in the middle with your thumb to create a slight indentation (this will help the patties cook evenly)."
  - "Cook the patties on the BBQ or frying pan for 5 minutes on each side."
  - "Toast the burger buns and assemble the burgers with your choice of toppings."
notes:
  - "Many burger recipes use eggs to keep the patties together, but I find them unnecessary."
  - "I sometimes like to mix in mum's feijoa BBQ sauce to the patties, but the sugars in this does mean the patties can burn more easily."
  - "This works best with beef mince that has fat in it (so not the premium mince). But get good mince from the butcher."
commentary: "The patties. It's all about the patties."
