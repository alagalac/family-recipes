title: "Tiramisu"
prep_time: "20 mins"
cook_time: "5 mins"
servings: "8"
ingredients:
  - 3 egg yolks
  - 1/4 cup caster sugar (56g)
  - 1 tsp vanilla essence
  - 250g mascarpone
  - 300ml cream
  - 1 cup strong, freshly brewed coffee (250ml)
  - 6 Tbsp coffee liqueur (e.g. Kahlua or Tia Maria)
  - 24 large sponge fingers or savoiardi biscuits
  - 1-2 Tbsp cocoa powder
instructions:
  - Prepare a double boiler by bringing a few centimetres of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Place a glass or stainless steel bowl over the top, so that it fits snugly without touching the water below.
  - Place egg yolks, caster sugar and vanilla in the bowl. Whisk until thick, pale and creamy (3-4 minutes). Remove from heat.
  - Place the mascarpone and cream in a separate large bowl. Using an electric mixer, whip to soft peaks. Fold into the egg mixture.
  - Mix the coffee with the coffee liqueur. Dunk the sponge fingers quickly in the coffee mixture, making sure they are completely immersed. Don't leave them in for more than a second or two as they can turn soggy.
  - Layer one third of the sponge fingers in a serving dish (approximately 24cm x 16cm) and top with a third of the mascarpone cream. Repeat twice to form three layers.
  - Sift cocoa evenly over the top. Cover and chill for at least 3 hours before serving.
notes:
  - "To save time you can substitute the egg yolk mixture with 1 cup (250g) of store-bought custard."
  - "Blend the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone before you fold in the whipped cream and it will come out perfectly fluffy"
commentary: "I often make this for Christmas. It's one of Kimmie's favourites and is always a hit."
