title: Feijoa Chutney
prep_time: 30 minutes
cook_time: 3 hours
servings: 8-10 jars
ingredients:
  - 1.5 kg feijoas, peeled and chopped
  - 500 g apples, peeled and chopped
  - 500 g onions, finely sliced
  - 750 ml malt vinegar
  - 750 g soft brown sugar
  - 1 tbsp salt
  - 1 tbsp ground ginger
  - 2 tbsp ground allspice
  - 1 tbsp crushed garlic
  - 1 lemon, finely grated zest of
  - 1/2 tsp mace
  - 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
  - 1/2 tsp ground cloves
instructions:
  - Place all ingredients in large pot and bring to a boil.
  - Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally towards the end, until mixture is thick and brown (up to 3 hours).
  - Bottle into sterile jars while warm.
  - Keeps for months.
  - Refrigerate once open.
notes:
  - A great way to use up excess feijoas!
  - Some feijoa varieties are much sweeter and juicier than others, so your chutney may vary from one batch to the next. We have reduced the vinegar in this recipe from 1 litre to 750ml, but you may wish to try it after it has cooked for an hour and adjust the flavour balance to suit your taste.
  - The cooking time will vary depending on the juiciness of your feijoas and the size of your pot. If you are making a double batch it will take even longer to reduce.

commentary: This is the recipe which mum uses to make feijoa chutney. It's one of my favourites to eat on toast with swiss cheese. Kimmie hates it!
