    - 50g plain flour
    - 2 eggs, lightly beaten
    - 100g panko breadcrumbs
    - 75ml vegetable oil, for deep-frying

    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 1 garlic clove, crushed
    - 2.5cm piece of ginger, peeled and grated
    - 1 tsp turmeric
    - 2 heaped tbsp mild curry powder

    - 100ml coconut milk
    - 1 tsp light soy sauce
    - 1 tsp sugar, to taste
instructions:
  Make the sauce:
    - Heat 2-3 tbsp vegetable oil in a saucepan. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and cook until softened.
    - Add the curry powder and turmeric, and cook for another minute on low to medium heat.
    - Stir in 1 tbsp flour and cook for 1 minute with the spices.
    - Gradually add the chicken or vegetable stock, then the coconut milk. Add a pinch of sugar, salt, and a dash of soy sauce. Simmer until thickened.
    - Strain the sauce through a sieve, a little at a time, to make it smooth. Set aside and keep warm.
  Make the dish:
    - Cook the rice according to the packet instructions.
    - Slice each chicken breast in half horizontally to make 4 fillets. Coat each fillet in flour, dip in beaten egg, then coat in panko breadcrumbs.
    - Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the chicken fillets until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels.
    - Slice the chicken into strips. Serve with rice, salad leaves, and plenty of curry sauce.
