title: "Spaghetti Carbonara (Traditional)"
prep_time: "5m"
cook_time: "15m"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  Main:
    - 175g guanciale (or pancetta or block bacon), skin removed
    - 2 large eggs
    - 2 egg yolks
    - 100g parmigiano reggiano, finely shredded (or pecorino romano, or parmesan)
    - 1/4 tsp black pepper
    - 400g spaghetti
    - 1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt (for pasta water)
    - 1/2 cup pasta cooking water
    - 1 garlic clove, finely minced (optional)
  Garnish (optional):
    - Parsley, finely chopped
    - Parmigiano reggiano
instructions:
  - Cut guanciale into 0.5cm thick slices, then into batons.
  - Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine, then stir in parmesan and pepper.
  - Bring 4 litres of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per packet directions.
  - Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain pasta.
  - While pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Cook for 4-5 minutes until golden. No oil needed. If using garlic, add in the last minute.
  - Tip hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.
  - Transfer pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously for 1 minute until sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to pasta.
  - Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with extra parmigiano reggiano, black pepper, and parsley if desired.
notes:
  - Use bacon instead of guanciale and parmesan instead of parmigiano reggiano for a more economical version.
commentary: "Kimmie likes creamy pasta dishes. I really like this more traditional version of carbonara, which is creamy without using cream."
