prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "25 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 1 onion, sliced
  - 400g chicken breast fillets, sliced into thin strips
  - 1 tbsp green curry paste
  - 1 can (400ml) coconut milk
  - 1 can bamboo shoots, drained
  - 1 red capsicum, sliced
  - 1 carrot, sliced into half-moons
  - 1 can baby corn, drained and halved
  - 100g green beans, trimmed and halved
  - 2 tbsp fish sauce
  - 1 tsp brown sugar
  - juice of 1 lemon or lime
  - corriander leaves, to garnish
  - 1 1/2 cups rice
instructions:
  - Cook rice according to package instructions.
  - Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add a little oil and cook the sliced onion for 2-3 minutes until softened.
  - Add the chicken strips and cook for 4-5 minutes until browned all over.
  - Add the green curry paste and cook, stirring, for 1 minute until fragrant.
  - Pour in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.
  - Add the bamboo shoots, capsicum, carrot, baby corn, and green beans. Simmer for 8-10 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the chicken is cooked through.
  - Stir in the fish sauce, brown sugar, and lemon or lime juice. Adjust seasoning to taste.
  - Serve the curry over the cooked rice, garnished with fresh coriander leaves.
notes:
  - The key to this recipe is to balance the flavours of salty (fish sauce), sweet (brown sugar), sour (lime juice), and spicy (curry paste). Adjust to taste as needed.
  - You can substitute the vegetables with what you have on hand such as zucchini, brocolli, cauliflower, or snow peas.
  - If you don't have green curry paste, you can make your own using chilli powder, tumeric, ground corriander, and ground cumin.
  - Keffir lime leaves would go very well in this recipe!
