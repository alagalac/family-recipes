title: "Pumpkin Soup"
prep_time: "5m"
cook_time: "10m"
servings: "4-6"
ingredients:
  Main:
    - 1.2 kg pumpkin (any type), unpeeled weight
    - 1 onion, sliced (white, brown, yellow)
    - 2 garlic cloves, peeled whole
    - 3 cups vegetable or chicken broth/stock, low sodium
    - 1 cup water
    - Salt and pepper
  Finishes:
    - 1/2 - 3/4 cup cream, half and half, or milk
    - Crusty bread, to serve
instructions:
  - Cut the pumpkin into 3cm slices. Cut the skin off and scrape seeds out. Cut into 4cm chunks.
  - Place pumpkin, onion, garlic, broth and water in a pot (liquid won't quite cover all the pumpkin). Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat and simmer rapidly until pumpkin is tender (about 10 minutes).
  - Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend until smooth.
  - Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir through cream (never boil soup after adding cream, cream will split).
  - Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle over a bit of cream, sprinkle with pepper and parsley if desired. Serve with crusty bread!
notes:
  - If you don't have cream, use milk or add a knob of butter.
  - We sometimes add sour cream when serving.
