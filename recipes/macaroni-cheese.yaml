title: "Baked Mac and Cheese"
prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "1 hour"
serves: "6-8"
ingredients:
  Macaroni:
    - "250g / 8 oz macaroni (elbow pasta)"
    - "1 tbsp (15g) unsalted butter (or 2 tsp oil)"
  Topping:
    - "2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs"
    - "2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter, melted"
    - "1/4 tsp salt"
  Sauce:
    - "4 tbsp (60g) unsalted butter"
    - "1/3 cup plain / all-purpose flour"
    - "3 cups milk, warmed (low or full fat)"
    - "2 cups freshly shredded cheese (Gruyere recommended)"
    - "1 cup freshly shredded mozzarella (or more cheese of choice)"
    - "3/4 tsp salt"
  Seasonings (optional):
    - "1 tsp garlic powder"
    - "1/2 tsp onion powder"
    - "1/2 tsp mustard powder"
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 180°C."
  - "Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet directions, but reduce cooking time by 1 minute (cook 'al dente'). Drain well."
  - "Toss in butter: Return drained pasta to the pot, add 1 tbsp butter and toss until melted and coating each piece. Set aside while you make the sauce (this helps stop the pasta swelling and becoming stodgy)."
  - "Make the topping: Combine panko breadcrumbs, melted butter and 1/4 tsp salt in a small bowl. Set aside."
  - "Make the sauce (roux method): In a large saucepan or ovenproof skillet, melt 4 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to make a roux."
  - "Add milk: Add about 1 cup of warmed milk, whisk to dissolve the roux, then add remaining milk and whisk until smooth and lump-free."
  - "Season and thicken: Add salt and any optional seasonings. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5-8 minutes until the sauce thickens to a cream consistency (it should coat the back of a spoon)."
  - "Add cheese: Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the shredded cheeses - they don't need to fully melt on the stove. Taste and adjust salt."
  - "Assemble: Pour the cheese sauce into the pot with the butter-coated macaroni and stir quickly to combine. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish or keep in an ovenproof skillet. Sprinkle the breadcrumb topping evenly over the surface."
  - "Bake: Bake at 180°C for about 25 minutes, or until the top is light golden and the sauce is bubbly. Do not overbake or the dish will dry out."
  - "Serve: Remove from oven and serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley if desired."
notes:
  - "Grate your own cheese for best results — pre-grated cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can make sauces grainy."
  - "Tossing the cooked pasta with butter before adding sauce prevents the pasta from swelling and keeps the final dish saucy rather than stodgy."
  - "This recipe reheats well; reheat gently and consider adding a splash of milk if the sauce has thickened in the fridge."
  - "Make-ahead: Assemble without the breadcrumb topping, refrigerate, add breadcrumbs just before baking and bake until hot and golden."
