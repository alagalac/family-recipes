title: No Knead Bread
prep_time: 5 minutes + 3 hours rising
cook_time: 45 minutes
servings: 1 loaf
ingredients:
  - 3 cups high grade flour (450g)
  - 2 teaspoons instant yeast
  - 2 teaspoon salt
  - 1 1/2 cups very warm water (375ml)
instructions:
  - Mix the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl, then add the water and stir. The dough should be very sticky.
  - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for 3 hours.
  - After 3 hours, the dough should be bubbly and doubled in size.
  - Preheat the oven to 220Â°C fan-forced and place a Dutch oven (with lid) inside to heat up.
  - Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and fold in each of the sides, then flip upside down onto a sheet of baking paper.
  - Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven and place the dough inside.
  - Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes.
  - Remove the lid and bake for an additional 15 minutes, until the bread is golden brown.
  - Let cool before slicing.
notes:
  - To be honest, I don't bother preheating the Dutch oven. I just put the dough in and it works fine.
  - If using normal bread yeast, dissolve the yeast in the water first.

commentary: 'For when not making sourdough, this is my favourite bread recipe. It tastes great for a non-sourdough recipe.'
