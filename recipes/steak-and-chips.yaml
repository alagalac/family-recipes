servings: "4"
ingredients:
  Steak and Chips:
  - 2 big scotch fillet steaks (aim for 125g per person)
  - 1 kg potatoes (for chips)
  - 1 bunch green vegetables (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, etc.)
  Mushroom Sauce:
  - 200g sliced mushrooms
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
  - 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
  - 1/2 cup cream
  Chimmichurri Sauce:
  - 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped (or other leafy green herbs)
  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
  - 1 clove garlic, minced
  Plum Sauce:
  - I use my mum's plum sauce.
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 220°C (428°F).
  - Cut the potatoes into chips and soak them in water for 30 minutes.
  - Drain and pat the potatoes dry, then toss with oil and seasonings.
  - Spread the chips on a baking tray and bake for 30-40 minutes until golden and crispy.
  - Meanwhile, season the steaks with salt and pepper and cook them in a hot pan for 3-4 minutes each side for medium-rare.
  - Serve the steaks with the chips and your choice of sauce.
notes:
  - The key to cooking steak is to firstly let it come to room temperature before cooking, secondly to season it with salt 5 minutes before cooking, and thirdly to let it rest for 5 minutes after cooking.
  - Easier than making chips, we often just roast chopped potatoes.
  - You can use other cuts of steak, but scotch fillet is my favourite.
commentary: "Lots of people don't know how to cook steak, and just chuck it on the BBQ with no seasoning. I cooked steak for some of my friends using this method some of my friends said it was the best steak they'd ever had."
