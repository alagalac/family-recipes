title: Gnocchi
prep_time: 30 minutes
cook_time: 1 hour 15 minutes
servings: 4
ingredients:
  Gnocchi:
    - 700-800g agria potatoes, scrubbed (leave the skin on the potatoes)
    - 1 free-range egg
    - ¾ teaspoon salt
    - 150g '00' Italian flour (or plain flour)
  Tomato Basil Sauce:
    - ¼ cup olive oil
    - 4 cloves garlic, sliced
    - 1 400g can Italian crushed tomatoes
    - 1 generous handful basil leaves
    - 150g fresh cow's mozzarella (or shredded/grated mozzarella)
    - 1 small handful parmesan, grated
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 200°C. Place whole potatoes on an oven tray and bake for about 1 hour (depending on the size of potatoes) until very tender - test with a skewer or tip of a sharp knife; it should poke right through with no resistance.
  - Cut potatoes in half and peel off the skins while still warm. Push warm potato flesh through a potato ricer or a sieve (with the help of the back of a large spoon) into a large bowl. This ensures light gnocchi; whatever you do, do not mash the potato.
  - Add egg and salt and mix in with a fork. Sift in flour and use your hands to bring together as a soft dough. Add a little more flour if needed - it should feel dry to the touch, but not crumbly. Knead a few times, then divide into six pieces.
  - On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece out into a log about 30cm long, then cut into bite-sized 2cm pieces. Gently push the tip of your thumb or finger into the centre of each piece to make a little indent (this makes the perfect little hollow for sauce to pool in). Place in a large dish or on a tray (with a lip) dusted with flour, and shake pieces around to coat. Set aside until ready to cook.
  - Bring a large pot of well-salted water to the boil and preheat oven to grill. While water is coming to the boil, make the sauce. Heat olive oil in a large heatproof fry pan on medium heat. Sizzle garlic for 1-2 minutes (but do not let it brown), then stir in crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 5-8 minutes until thickened, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir through basil.
  - Drop about half of the gnocchi (one by one) into the boiling water and cook for a couple of minutes, scooping them out with a slotted spoon as they bob to the surface. Transfer straight into the pan of hot tomato sauce.
  - Once all the gnocchi are in the pan, gently toss to coat in sauce and top with mozzarella and parmesan. Place under the oven grill for about 5 minutes or until sauce is bubbling and mozzarella is melted. Serve immediately.
notes:
  - This recipe also works well with pumpkin or kumara instead of potato.
