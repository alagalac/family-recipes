prep_time: "5 minutes"
cook_time: "10 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 1 tin (400g) cooked lentils, drained and rinsed
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - Juice of 1/2 lemon
  - 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses
  - 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, roasted and crushed
  - 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
  - 3 spring onions, thinly sliced
  - 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
  - 1/2 cup pomegranate seeds
  - 1/4 cup icing sugar (optional, if making candied walnuts)
instructions:
  - (Optional) To make candied walnuts, cook walnuts in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain well. Toss walnuts with icing sugar. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a small frying pan over medium heat, add walnuts and cook for 2 minutes until golden. Remove from heat and let cool on parchment paper, season to taste.
  - Shake the olive oil, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, and crushed cumin seeds together in a small jar to make the dressing.
  - In a large bowl, combine the cooked lentils, chopped walnuts, sliced spring onions, and chopped parsley.
  - Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine.
  - Just before serving, sprinkle the pomegranate seeds on top for a burst of color and flavour.
notes:
  - This is a versatile recipe. We sometimes like to add feta cheese.
commentary: "This recipe was sent to us by Kimmie's grand nonna. She altered the original recipe to have pomegranate seeds and candied walnuts (instead of regular walnuts)."
