ingredients:
  Cake:
    - 250g unsalted butter
    - 250g good-quality dark chocolate
    - 85g sifted Dutch-processed cocoa powder
    - 200g roasted pecans
    - 6 free-range eggs
    - 1 1/2 cups (330g) caster sugar
    - 1/3 cup (80ml) brandy or cognac
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
    - Icing sugar (optional) for dusting or Ganache (see recipe below)
    - Lightly sweetened double thick cream, to serve
  Ganache (shiny chocolate icing):
    - 250g good-quality dark chocolate, broken into small chunks
    - 125g unsalted butter
    - 50ml water
instructions:
  Cake:
  - Preheat your oven to 180C. Butter a 23cm springform tin and line the base with buttered baking paper. Dust the tin with flour (or rice flour if you're avoiding wheat completely), and tap out the excess. Set it aside.
  - Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over low heat. Add the chocolate and whisk it in until it's melted too. Take the pan off the heat, then add the cocoa, stirring it in until the mixture is thick and smooth. Set it aside to cool a little.
  - Meanwhile, whiz the pecans in a food processor to chop them as finely as possible. Keep an eye on them as you do this, stopping the machine every so often to check them so they don’t become oily and form a paste. Set them aside.
  - In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar with a balloon whisk until they're just blended together, then whisk in the warm chocolate mixture until it's well combined. Mix in the brandy and vanilla extract. Finally, stir in the ground pecans – at this stage the batter looks very loose and sloppy but that’s just how it should be.
  - Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Pop it in the oven and bake the cake for 40-45 minutes or until the sides are set but the middle 15cm or so of the cake is still a bit wobbly when you gently shake the tin.
  - Remove it to a wire rack and leave the cake to cool completely in the tin. Once cool, release the sides of the tin and carefully invert the cake onto a plate lined with baking paper. Cover the cake with plastic wrap, and chill it in the fridge, where it keeps well for at least a week.
  - When you're ready to eat it, slide the cake off the baking paper onto a serving dish then dust it with icing sugar. Serve it with cream.

  Ganache (shiny chocolate icing):
  - Makes about 1 3/4 cups - enough to ice 2 medium-sized cakes
  - Ganache is lovely stuff and terribly easy to make. There are lots of different versions of it (many use cream rather than butter), but basically whatever recipe you use, you end up with a silky, chocolate glaze that forms a glossy icing when it’s poured over a cake.
  - Put the chocolate, butter and water into a medium-sized, heavy-based saucepan over low heat. Let the chocolate and butter melt, stirring the mixture frequently, until the ganache is smooth. (I use a small, flat sauce whisk for this, as it gets right into the corners of the pan where the chocolate tends to clump a bit.) The most important thing to keep in mind when you’re making ganache is that it mustn’t get too hot and boil – if it does, it becomes oily and grainy and there’s not much chance of salvaging it, I’m afraid. Once it’s silky smooth, take it off the heat and let it cool until it’s barely warm and of a thick pouring consistency. Pour as much as you need evenly over the cake so it trickles down the sides. Leave the ganache to set
  - Scrape any leftover ganache into an airtight container, seal it tightly and store it in the fridge. When you're ready to use it, gently warm it over very low heat, then let it cool to the right consistency. It’s wonderful to have on hand when you want to dress up a cake in a hurry, as all you need do is swoosh some ganache over it and it immediately looks chic and special.

notes:
  - Dutch-processed cocoa removes some of the cocoa's acidity, giving it a softer, smoother flavour, richer colour, and tends to dissolve more easily. Usually available in good delicatessens and specialty food shops.
  - This is a dense, rich and very chocolate-y cake that dissolves on your tongue, leaving a hint of dark, bitter-sweet warmth.
  - Ganache sets beautifully most of the time, but like all chocolate, it's a bit temperamental in hot, humid weather. If it won't set and is still sticky, put the ganache-coated cake, uncovered, in the fridge for a short time so the quick burst of chilled air sets it.
  - In hot, humid weather, store the cake in the fridge. Put the cake uncovered in the fridge until the ganache has set, then cover it in plastic wrap. Before serving, remove the wrap and return the cake to cool room temperature so the ganache regains its sheen.
  - Ganache makes about 1 3/4 cups - enough to ice 2 medium-sized cakes.
commentary: "This is the cake recipe which Nonna often uses for special occasions. Very decadent and rich!"
