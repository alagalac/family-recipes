ingredients:
  Stock:
    - 2 chicken backs (carcases) or bones left over from cooked whole chicken
    - 1 large onion, quartered
    - 1-2 carrots cut length-wise and halved
    - 2-3 stalks parsley
    - 1 bay leaf
  Soup:
    - 1 small onion, finely chopped
    - 1-2cm peeled ginger, grated
    - 470g can creamed sweet corn
    - 1-2 tbsp oil (sunflower, canola, or olive)
    - 2 stock cubes (chicken or vegetable)
    - 4-5 tbsp cornflour
    - salt and pepper
    - reserved meat off carcases
    - 8 cups chicken stock (see above)
    - 1/2 cup frozen corn kernals (optional)
instructions:
  Stock:
    - Place all ingredients in a large stock pot with lid and cover with water (about 2 litres).
    - Bring to boil over medium heat, skim well to remove scum. Reduce heat and simmer gently covered for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
    - Strain into large jug. Pick meat off carcas and reserve.
  Soup:
    - Combine in a large saucepan the finely chopped onion and grated ginger with 1-2 tbsp oil and cook until soft but not browned.
    - Remove from heat and stir in 7-8 cups of chicken stock, creamed sweetcorn, crumbled stock cubes, and meat off chicken carcas. Return to stove top and heat gently on medium.
    - Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix 4-5 tbsp cornflour with 4-5 tbsp water to make a paste. Then stir this into the saucepan mixture with a wooden spoon. Bring to the boil, stirring with spoon and boil for 2-3 minutes as it thickens. Cool slightly and add salt and pepper to taste.
notes:
  - The amount of cornflour will determine the thickness of the soup.
  - Can add 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernals.
  - I like to sometimes add a beaten egg and / or noodles to the soup for somehting extra.
