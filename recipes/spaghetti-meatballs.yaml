title: "Spaghetti Meatballs"
prep_time: "20 mins"
cook_time: "20 mins"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 400g beef mince
  - 1 small onion, grated
  - 1 egg
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 50g breadcrumbs
  - 1 tsp dried mixed herbs
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 400g canned crushed tomatoes
  - 400g spaghetti
  - 20g grated Parmesan cheese
instructions:
  - Place the beef mince, grated onion, egg, breadcrumbs, dried mixed herbs, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are combined.
  - Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about the size of a golf ball. I use a tablespoon scoop to measure and shape them evenly.
  - Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add a little oil. Cook the meatballs in batches, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through (about 10-12 minutes). Remove the meatballs from the pan and set aside.
  - In the same pan, add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the canned crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes to thicken slightly. Add salt to season.
  - While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, saving a little pasta water.
  - Return the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for another 5 minutes to let the flavors meld together, adding a splash of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.
  - Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese before serving.
notes:
  - Pork mince (or a pork-beef mix) also works well in this recipe.
  - For extra vegetables, add a grated carrot or courgette to the sauce.
  - If available, fresh herbs work well in the meatball mixture instead of dried.
  - Add BBQ sauce (or even better Feijoa BBQ sauce) to the meatball mix for more flavour.
