ingredients:
  Cookies:
    - "225g butter, softened (or Olivani Spread)"
    - "¾ cup Chelsea White Sugar (170g)"
    - "1½ tsp vanilla essence"
    - "¼ tsp salt"
    - "1 egg"
    - "2 cups plain flour (300g)"
  Royal Icing:
    - "2 egg whites"
    - "1 tsp lemon juice (strained to remove any pulp)"
    - "3½ cups Chelsea Icing Sugar (525g)"
    - "Water"
instructions:
  Cookies:
    - "Using an electric mixer, beat butter and Chelsea White Sugar together until pale and creamy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally."
    - "Beat in vanilla and salt. Add egg and beat well."
    - "Slowly add the flour and mix until just combined."
    - "Place some cling film on the bench and tip the mixture into this. Slightly flatten into an oval shape. Wrap up well and refrigerate for at least two hours."
    - "Preheat oven to 160°C and line two baking trays with baking paper."
    - "Split the dough into two portions to make it easier to work with. Knead the dough gently using well-floured hands, then on a well-floured bench, roll the dough to the desired thickness (5mm works well)."
    - "Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes and carefully transfer to prepared trays."
    - "Continue to create shapes, kneading the dough scraps back together, until all dough is used."
    - "Bake for 13-15 minutes, until pale golden. Keep an eye on them from about 12 minutes, to ensure they don't brown too much."
    - "Cool on trays for 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
  Royal Icing:
    - "Place the egg whites and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine."
    - "Add the Chelsea Icing Sugar one cup at a time, mixing well in between with electric beaters, until fully incorporated. Add the last ½ cup a little at a time, until you reach soft peaks (you may not need to use all of it)."
    - "You can test for the correct consistency of icing by dragging a knife over the surface. If the surface smoothes over in approximately 10 seconds, the icing is at the right consistency. Mix in water in very small quantities, until this consistency is achieved."
    - "Split the icing into small bowls if you wish to make different colours. Add food colour if desired (gel colours work best)."
    - "Spoon into ziplock plastic bags or piping bags fitted with small round piping tips, ready for icing."
notes:
  - "Alternatively use a simple icing sugar and milk icing instead."
commentary: "We made these cookies for Lexie's Playcentre graduation and they were a hit with the kids."
