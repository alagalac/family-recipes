ingredients:
  Patties:
    - 250-300g kumara, peeled and diced
    - 2 tbsp olive oil
    - 250g portobello mushrooms, stalks removed then diced
    - 1 onion, finely chopped
    - 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    - 1 tbsp curry powder
    - 1 tsp ground cumin
    - zest of 1 lemon
    - 400g can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
    - 3/4 cup breadcrumbs
    - 1 egg
    - 3/4 tsp salt
    - 1/3 cup finely chopped basil, parsley, and/or coriander
  Optional extras:
    - 6 portobello mushrooms
    - 6 slices eggplant
  To serve:
    - 6 slices cheddar
    - 6 burger buns, split in half
    - Tomato relish
    - Pickles
    - 2-3 tomatoes, sliced
    - 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
    - Lettuce leaves
    - 1/3 cup mayonnaise
    - 1/2 tsp curry powder
instructions:
  - Cook kumara in boiling salted water for about 10 minutes or until soft. Drain well, tiop back into pot and place over low heat for a few minutes to dry off.
  - Meanwhile, heat oil in a large fry pan on medium-high heat. Cook mushroomes and onion, with a good pinch of salt for 6-8 minutes or until soft and all moisture in the pan (from the mushrooms) has evaporated. Add another drizzle of oil, garlic, curry powder, cumin, and lemon zest and continue cooking for 1 minute.
  - Add mushroom and onion mixture to the pot with the kumara, along with chickpeas, breadcrumbs, egg, salt, and herbs. Use a potato masher to mash everything together and season with pepper.
  - Divide and roll mixture into 6 large balls (about 3/4 cup each). Flatten and shape each ball into patties 1.5cm thick. Place in the fridge to firm up while you prepare everything else.
  - Oil each patty and cook on BBQ hotplate or large frying pan over medium-high heat for a few minutes each side until golden and cooked through. If using, drizzle portobello mushrooms and eggplant slices with oil, season, and cook until soft and golden.
  - Top each patty with cheese and melt under the grill, if desired. Lightly toast burger buns.
  - To assemble burgers, spread bottom hald with relish, top with pickles, a patty and cheese, eggplant/mushroom (if using), tomato, onion, and lettuce. Mix mayo and curry powder together and spread on top half of bun.
