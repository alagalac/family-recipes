title: "Schnitzel"
prep_time: "10 minutes"
cook_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  Pick one:
    - "600g boneless pork (4 steaks / boneless chops, about 150g each)"
    - "600g large chicken breasts (2 pieces, 300g each)"
    - "600g veal or beef steaks (4 pieces, 150g each)"
  Schnitzel Coating:
    - "Salt and pepper"
    - "3/4 cup flour"
    - "2 eggs"
    - "1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs"
    - "Oil for frying (canola, vegetable)"
  To serve:
    - Mashed potato
    - Steamed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, green beans)
    - Horseradish sauce (if using beef or veal)
instructions:
  - "If using chicken breast, cut in half horizontally to create two steaks."
  - "Place the protein of choice on a work surface and cover with baking paper or cling wrap. Use a rolling pin to pound to even thickness about 0.8 cm thick (don't pound too thin, hard to handle / might tear)."
  - "Sprinkle both sides of meat with salt and pepper."
  - "Place flour in one dish, panko in another, and whisk eggs in a bowl."
  - "Coat meat in flour, shake off excess. Dip into egg, shake off excess. Press into breadcrumbs, and turn, pressing to adhere, then transfer to plate. Repeat for all pieces."
  - "Heat 1.5cm oil in a heavy based deep skillet over medium high heat."
  - "Dip the end of a schnitzel in to check if the oil is hot enough - it should sizzle straight away."
  - "Carefully place 2 schnitzels in the oil and cook for 3 minutes until deep golden, turn then cook the other side for 3 minutes."
  - "Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining schnitzel."
  - "Serve with lemon wedges. Optionally serve with mushroom gravy or potato rosti."
notes:
  - This recipe also works well with chips and a green salad.
  - Careful with how you dispose of the oil. Don't pour it down the sink!
commentary: "One of Kimmie's favourite meals is schnitzel. I don't tend to like making it as often the coating sticks to the pan and the cuts of meat aren't great. But this recipe seams to be okay."
