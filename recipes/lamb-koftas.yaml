title: "Lamb Koftas"
prep_time: "15 minutes"
cook_time: "15 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  Koftas:
  - 500g lamb mince
  - 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
  - 1/2 onion, grated
  - 1 tsp ground coriander
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1 tsp cumin
  - 1 tsp dried mixed herbs (or fresh finely chopped)
  - 1 tsp salt
  To Serve:
  - 4 flat breads (use the flatbread recipe if you like)
  - 1 tsp mint, finely chopped
  - 1/2 cup Greek yoghurt
  - Grilled vegetables (eggplant, capsicum, courgette)
instructions:
  - Add all of the ingredients for the lamb koftas to a large bowl and mix to combine.
  - With damp hands, divide the meat into 8 equal portions and shape onto sausage shapes.
  - Start BBQing the vegetables first, turning occasionally. Then BBQ the koftas for 15 minutes or until cooked through. Turning to brown on each side every few minutes.
  - Meanwhile, mix the mint through the Greek yoghurt to make a quick mint sauce.
  - Just before serving, warm the flatbreads on the BBQ for about 30 seconds each.
notes:
  - You can use skewers, but I tend not to.
  - Instead of the grilled vegetables, a hummus, tomato, and feta combo also works well.
  - Pearl couscous salad goes well inside these too, but it can get messy!
