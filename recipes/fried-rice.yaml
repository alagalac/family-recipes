    - "1/2 teaspoon ground coriander"
    - "1 teaspoon curry powder"
    - "2 kaffir lime leaves or 1 small lime/lemon tree leaf, very finely sliced (optional)"
    - "1 stalk lemongrass, finely chopped (optional)"
    - "4-5 cups leftover cooked rice"
    - "1 x 400g can pineapple chunks, well drained (reserve juice for other use)"
    - "1/2 cup roasted chopped cashew nuts or peanuts"

  fried_rice_sauce:
    - "1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons sweet chilli sauce"
    - "2 tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce (or 1 tablespoon each)"
    - "1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)"
    - "Pinch of chilli flakes (optional)"

  optional_extras:
    - "Crispy fried shallots"
    - "Finely sliced spring onion (green part)"
    - "Chopped fresh chilli"

instructions:
  - "Pat prawns/chicken/tofu dry and season with salt. Heat a drizzle of oil in a wok or large frypan over medium-high heat. Stir-fry protein for 4-5 minutes until cooked and golden. If using eggs, whisk with a pinch of salt and cook as an omelette, then break into pieces. Transfer protein/eggs to a large bowl and set aside."
  - "Add another 2 tablespoons oil to the wok and stir-fry onion, carrot, garlic, cabbage and peas/corn/green beans for about 5 minutes until starting to caramelise. Transfer vegetables to the bowl with the cooked protein."
  - "Mix all fried rice sauce ingredients together in a small bowl."
  - "Add a drizzle more oil to the pan, add turmeric, ground coriander, curry powder, kaffir lime leaf and lemongrass (if using) and sizzle for 30 seconds."
  - "Add cooked rice, drained pineapple, chopped cashews/peanuts and the fried rice sauce. Stir-fry and toss for about 5 minutes until well combined and heated through, allowing some rice to brown and form little crusty bits if desired."
  - "Return the cooked vegetables and protein/eggs to the pan, toss to combine, and season to taste with extra soy/fish sauce or salt."
  - "Serve topped with crispy shallots, spring onion and chopped chilli if using."

tips:
  - "Use day-old rice from the fridge, or spread freshly cooked rice on a tray and cool in the freezer for 30 minutes to dry it out."
  - "For extra flavour cook rice in a 50/50 mix of coconut milk and water to make coconut rice."
  - "If you don't have turmeric or coriander, add an extra teaspoon of curry powder."
  - "Kaffir lime leaves can be substituted with a small lime/lemon tree leaf or a little lime zest."
  - "Cooked rice will keep for up to 2 days in the fridge if well covered."
