title: "Focaccia Bread"
prep_time: "1 hour 30 minutes"
cook_time: "15-20 minutes"
servings: "1 loaf"
ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 garlic cloves, finely minced
  - 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
  - 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried
  - 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
  - 1 cup (235 ml) warm water
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)
  - 1/4 teaspoon honey
  - 2 1/2 cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
instructions:
  - In a cold medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and the black pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes or until aromatic, but before the garlic browns. Set aside.
  - In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes.
  - Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. Once the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead the dough 10 to 15 times until smooth. Transfer to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. (It’s best to let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen).
  - After 1 hour, heat oven to 450°F (230°C). Use two tablespoons of the remaining garlic-olive oil mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet.
  - Transfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the garlic-olive oil mixture. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly.
  - Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia bread on a wire rack.
notes: "Don't skimp on the herbs. Do more that the recipe says if you like."
commentary: "This is my go-to focaccia recipe. A couple of times as potluck lunches other people have made focaccia bread too, but this one is always the best."
