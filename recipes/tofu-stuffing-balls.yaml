instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 220°C (or 200°C fan bake).
  - Finely chop cranberries. Pat tofu dry and crumble into a medium bowl. Add cranberries, onion powder, garlic powder, italian herbs, lemon pepper, pistachios, flour, plant-based milk, breadcrumbs, and salt to bowl and mix well using your hands, until combined. Set aside.
  - Peel and dice the pumpkin into 1cm cubes. Toss pumpkin on a medium lined oven tray with oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast on lower rack for 25-30 minutes, until golden.
  - Squeeze tofu mixture firmly into golf ball-sized balls and place on a lined oven tray. Drizzle stuffing balls with oil. Bake on upper oven rack for 15-20 minutes, until golden and cooked through.
  - Trim beans and asparagus. Heat oil in a medium frypan on high heat. Cook beans and asparagus with a pinch of salt for 4-5 minutes, until tender and starting to brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  - Just before serving, heat gravy in a small pot on medium heat for 2-3 minutes to warm through.
  - Serve roasties, beans and stuffing balls topped with gravy. Serve horseradish aioli on the side for dipping.
notes:
  - Use your hands to crumble the tofu. The pieces should be no larger than 1/2 cm.
commentary: "It turns out one of our favourite parts of a roast chicken is the stuffing, so why not have a meal based on stuffing! The tofu keeps the stuffing balls nice and moist."
