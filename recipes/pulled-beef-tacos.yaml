prep_time: "20 minutes"
cook_time: "3 hours"
servings: "20 tacos (8 - 10 servings)"
ingredients:
  Spice Mix:
    - 1.5 tbsp chipotle powder (adjust spiciness to taste)
    - 1 tbsp paprika
    - 1 tbsp dried oregano
    - 1 tsp All Spice powder
    - 1 tsp coriander powder
    - 2 tsp onion powder or garlic powder (or 1 tsp of each)
    - 1 tsp salt and pepper (each)
  Beef:
    - 1-2 tbsp olive oil
    - 3 lb / 1.5kg beef chuck or brisket (or gravy or any other slow cooking beef), cut into 4 pieces
    - 5 garlic cloves, minced
    - 1 onion, diced (yellow, brown or white)
    - 3/4 cup (185 ml) orange juice
    - 2 tbsp lime juice
    - 14 oz / 400g can crushed tomatoes
    - 2 cups (500 ml) beef or chicken broth/stock
    - 1/2 cup (125ml) water
    - Salt and pepper
instructions:
  Cook:
    - Combine the Spice Mix ingredients in a bowl. Sprinkle 4 teaspoons over the beef and pat so it sticks.
    - Heat the olive oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add the beef (in batches if necessary) and brown well on all sides. Remove onto a plate.
    - Turn the stove down to medium. If the pot looks dry, add more olive oil.
    - Add the garlic and onion and cook for 3 minutes until soft.
    - Add the orange juice and lime juice, and scrape the bottom of the pot so the brown bits mix into the liquid.
    - Add tomato, beef stock, water and remaining spice mix. Mix, then return beef into pot.
    - Put the lid on, bring to a simmer then turn the stove down so it is bubbling gently, not rapidly.
    - Cook for 2 hours, then remove lid and simmer for another 30 minutes until beef is tender enough to shred.
    - Remove the beef from sauce, shred with 2 forks.
    - Leave the sauce to simmer with the lid off for 10 to 15 minutes to reduce and thicken to your taste. Adjust salt to taste. Optionally puree with stick blender to make it smooth.
    - Toss beef back into the sauce (can reserve some sauce for drizzling on tacos if you want, there's plenty).
    - Transfer beef into large dish and serve.
  Tacos:
    - To make tacos, serve the beef with warmed small tortillas, avocado slices, Pico de Gallo, shredded cheese, sour cream, lime wedges and extra coriander leaves.
notes:
  - "Other cooking methods: slow cooker for 8 hours on low, pressure cooker & Instant Pot on high for 50 minutes. For Slow Cooker and Pressure Cooker - after deglazing the pot in step 5 with the orange juice and lime juice, pour the liquid and onions into the slow/pressure cooker (IP) and add all remaining ingredients + beef. Cook per above. Transfer the liquid to a saucepan to reduce the sauce on the stove, as required by the recipe. Oven - after completing step 6, cover and place in 160C oven for 3 - 3 1/2 hours or until the beef is tender enough to shred. The liquid should reduce enough to make a thick sauce. If not, just simmer it on the stove until thickened to your liking."
commentary: "We cooked this in our pressure cooker for Len and Armine, and it worked well. We even used the leftovers for a mexican pizza the next day."
