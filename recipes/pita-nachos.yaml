title: "Greek Pita Nachos"
prep_time: "5 minutes"
cook_time: "20 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 1 packet pita bread, each cut into 8 triangles
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 500g lamb mince (or beef mince, or brown lentils for vegetarian)
  - 1 tin tomatoes with garlic and oregano
  - 1/4 cup Greek Kalamata olives, sliced
  - 1/4 cup feta, crumbled
instructions:
  - Heat a splash of oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2 minutes until softened.
  - Add the lamb mince, season well with salt and pepper, and cook until browned. Once browned, add the tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, or until reduced.
  - Meanwhile, brush the pita bread triangles with a little oil and bake in the oven at 200Â°C for 10 minutes, or until golden.
  - To serve, spread the pita chips on a plate, then top with the mince mixture, olives, and feta.
notes:
  - Take your nachos to the next level by whipping up some tzatziki to dollop on top. Mix 1 cup of Greek yoghurt with half a finely diced cucumber, the juice of a lemon and a handful of chopped mint, before seasoning with salt and pepper.
  - For extra flavour, sprinkle over some roughly chopped fresh mint.
  - The pita chips work well with more traditional nachos too.
commentary: "We find a lot of the corn chips are too salty, so we prefer to make our own pita chips. They get super crispy."
