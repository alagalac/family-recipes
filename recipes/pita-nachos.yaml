title: "Pita Nachos"
prep_time: "5 minutes"
cook_time: "20 minutes"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - 1 packet pita bread, each cut into 8 triangles
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 500g beef mince, or brown lentils for vegetarian
  - 1 tin tomatoes (400g)
  - 1 tin black beans, drained and rinsed
  - 2 tbsp taco seasoning (or mix 1 tsp each ground cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and a pinch of cayenne pepper)
  - 1 avocado
  - 1 tomato, diced
  - 1/4 cup grated cheese
instructions:
  - "Preheat oven to 200°C (fan 180°C). Line a baking tray with baking paper."
  - "Prepare the pita chips: lightly brush or spray pita triangles with oil, spread in a single layer on the tray and bake 8-12 minutes until crisp and golden. Remove and set aside."
  - "Meanwhile heat a splash of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until softened and translucent."
  - "Add the beef mince (or cooked brown lentils). Season with salt and pepper and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes)."
  - "Stir in the tin of tomatoes, beans, and taco seasoning (or spice mix). Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and cook gently for 10-15 minutes until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning."
  - "If using avocado and fresh tomato as toppings, prepare them now: dice tomato and mash the avocado; squeeze a little lemon or lime over the avocado to prevent browning."
  - "To assemble: scatter the pita chips on a serving platter or divide between plates, spoon the mince mixture over the chips, then top with grated cheese, diced tomato, avocado and other toppings such as olives, sour cream or salsa."
notes:
  - You can use regur corn chips (we prefer the mexicano natural ones), but we like the pita chips better.
commentary: "We find a lot of the corn chips are too salty, so we prefer to make our own pita chips. They get super crispy."
