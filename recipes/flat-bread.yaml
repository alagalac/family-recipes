title: "Garlic Butter Flatbreads"
prep_time: "10 minutes (+15-30 minutes resting)"
cook_time: "20 minutes"
servings: "4-6 flatbreads"
ingredients:
  Flatbreads:
    - "2 cups self-raising flour (or plain/high grade flour + 2 1/2 tsp baking powder)"
    - "3/4 cup milk (or plain yoghurt or water)"
    - "1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (or any oil)"
    - "1/4 teaspoon salt"
  Garlic herb butter (optional):
    - "2 tablespoons softened butter"
    - "1 clove garlic, finely chopped"
    - "2 teaspoons finely chopped parsley"
instructions:
  - "Place flour, milk, oil and salt in a bowl and mix to combine."
  - "Knead on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic."
  - "Divide the dough into 4 or 6 portions and rest on the bench for at least 15-30 minutes (longer is fine; wrap if resting overnight)."
  - "If making garlic & herb butter, mix softened butter, chopped garlic and parsley together and set aside."
  - "Heat a large heavy-based skillet or frypan over medium heat. Roll each piece of dough into a roughly 25cm circle and lightly brush with oil."
  - "Place the dough in the hot pan and cook about 2 minutes per side until puffed and golden. Repeat with remaining pieces."
  - "Brush with garlic herb butter while still hot, if using, and serve immediately."
tips:
  - "Rest the dough 15-30 minutes to relax the gluten; you can rest for several hours or overnight (wrap tightly in clingfilm if overnight)."
  - "For gluten-free flatbreads use gluten-free flour and milk or yoghurt (not water) to help bind the dough."
  - "To reheat, wrap flatbreads in foil and warm in the oven to prevent drying out."
  - "If you don't have a pastry brush, drizzle a little oil over each flatbread before placing it in the pan."

commentary: "A handy recipe for flat breads to save buying them from the shops. We eat these with curry or as a wrap for koftas."
