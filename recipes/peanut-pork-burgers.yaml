cook_time: "20 mins"
servings: "4"
ingredients:
  - "2 Sweet Potatoes, chopped into wedges"
  - "2 tbsp oil"
  - "1 tbsp Smoked Paprika"
  - "1/4 cup fresh Coriander, finely chopped"
  - "80g salted peanuts, roughly chopped"
  - "600g Pork Mince"
  - "2 Limes, zest and juice"
  - "3 tbsp Soy Sauce"
  - "80g Crunchy peanut butter"
  - "2 Baby Gem Lettuces, 1cm widthway strips"
  - "2 Carrots, grated"
  - "4 Brioche Buns, halved"
  - "Salt and pepepr"
instructions:
  - "Pre-heat your oven to 220 degrees. Chop the sweet potatoes into wedges roughly the width and length of your index finger. Put them on a baking tray, drizzle over 2 tbsp of oil, sprinkle over half the paprika, ½ tsp of salt and a grind of pepper. Make sure everything is evenly coated and put in your oven to cook for 25 mins."
  - "Roughly chop the coriander (stalks and leaves!) and zest the limes with a grater. Roughly chop the peanuts. Put the pork mince in a bowl and add three quarters of your coriander along with your lime zest, chopped peanuts, the other half of your paprika, half the soy sauce, ½ tsp of salt and a good grind of pepper."
  - "Combine everything together with your hands and shape into four burgers about 2cm thick. Tip: Don't make them too thick, they will change shape as the proteins tighten up while they are being cooked."
  - "Remove the tough rooty bit off the lettuce and cut into roughly 2cm slices. Peel, grate the carrot and mix it with the lettuce. Mix 2 tbsp of olive oil with the juice from one half of one of the limes and a pinch of salt and pepper, whisk together with a fork. Tip: If you're not that keen on lime, use a bit less than specified! Put most of your lettuce and carrot into a bowl (reserve a little to put on the burgers!) and throw in your limey dressing. Toss the salad."
  - "Put a frying pan on medium heat and add 2 tbsp of oil. Add your burgers and cook for 5 mins on each side before adding them to a baking tray. Put the burgers in your oven to carry on cooking for 5 mins while you make the sauce."
  - "Put the peanut butter in a bowl and add the juice from the other lime. Add 2 tbsp of water, the rest of the soy sauce and the rest of the coriander and mix everything together with a fork. Tip: Again, only add as much lime as you like to taste."
  - "Turn your grill to high and cut the brioche buns in half. Tip: If your oven and grill aren't separate just move your sweet potato and burgers down a shelf so the top shelf is free for grilling! Put your buns under the grill for a minute or 2 on each side to toast them. Tip: Keep an eye on them, you don't want them to burn!"
  - "When everything is ready, spread your satay sauce on the bottom half of your buns, pop your burgers on top, top with some lettuce carrot mixture and pop the bun top on. Serve with a side of sweet potato wedges and salad!"
