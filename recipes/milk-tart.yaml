prep_time: "20 mins (plus cooling)"
cook_time: "30 mins"
servings: "8-10"
ingredients:
  smear_crust:
    - "100g salted butter, softened"
    - "100g granulated sugar"
    - "100g plain flour"
    - "2 eggs (Size 7)"
  filling:
    - "600ml milk (for the pot)"
    - "150ml milk (for the mix)"
    - "150g granulated sugar"
    - "50g plain flour"
    - "50g cornflour (cornstarch)"
    - "2g table salt"
    - "100g salted butter"
    - "4 eggs, separated (Size 7)"
    - "10ml vanilla essence"
    - "Ground cinnamon, to sprinkle"
instructions:
  - "Prepare a 25cm pie dish with grease spray."
  - "For the smear crust: Cream 100g softened salted butter and 100g granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes."
  - "Add 2 eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Fold in 100g plain flour until the mixture is well combined."
  - "Using your fingers, smear a very thin, even layer of the mixture over the base and sides of the prepared pie dish. Use a light touch so the mixture distributes evenly; this forms a delicate thin crust. If you have extra mixture, freeze for later use."
  - "For the filling: Preheat the oven to 160°C (fan or conventional equivalent). Put 600ml milk into a pot and warm over medium-low heat until scalding (just below boiling)."
  - "In a separate bowl, whisk together 150ml milk, 150g granulated sugar, 50g plain flour, 50g cornflour and 2g salt into a smooth, lump-free paste."
  - "While stirring, gradually add the hot scalded milk to the paste to temper it, then return the combined mixture to the pot. Heat over medium-low, stirring continuously, until the mixture reaches its first boil and forms a thick plop (bubbles)."
  - "Transfer the hot milk mixture to a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk the 4 egg yolks and whisk them into the warm milk mixture. Add 100g salted butter and 10ml vanilla essence and stir until combined; the butter will melt into the warm custard. Set aside to cool slightly."
  - "In a clean bowl, whip the 4 egg whites to stiff peaks (but not dry)."
  - "Once the milk mixture has cooled to warm (not hot), fold the whipped egg whites gently into the milk mixture until just combined."
  - "Pour the filling gently into the prepared smear crust, smoothing the top. Sprinkle generously with ground cinnamon."
  - "Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is set and slightly golden."
  - "Serve warm from the oven or chilled from the fridge (many prefer chilled)."
notes:
  - "All eggs used in this recipe are Size 7 (large)."
  - "The smear crust recipe may give extra; leftover crust freezes well."
  - "Store milk tart in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days."
