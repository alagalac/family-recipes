servings: "4"
ingredients:
  Patties:
    - 2 sweet potatoes, skin on, washed, and roughly chopped
    - 2 tablespoons olive oil
    - 400g (2 cups) quinoa, rinsed
    - 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
    - 1 garlic clove, finely chopped
    - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
    - 1 fresh red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (optional)
    - 60g (1/2 cup) crushed walnuts, to serve
  Chreen tahini and lime dressing:
    - 2 tablespoons tahini
    - 2 tablespoons olive oil
    - 1 avocado
    - Juice and zest of 1 lime
    - 1/2 bunch coriander (save some leaves for serving)
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C.
  - Arrange sweet potato pieces on a baking tray, drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and bake for 20 minutes. At the same time put 750ml (3 cups) of water and the quinoa in a saucepan over a medium-high heat, bring it to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and all the liquid is gone.
  - When the spuds are cooked, pop them into a large mixing bowl, add your cooked quinoa and use a fork to mash everything together. Add the onion, garlic, cumin, and fresh chilli to the mix and season with salt and pepper. Shape the mixture into 8 large balls (you want these to look like little burger patties). Place the patties on a baking tray, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and bake for 15 minutes, or until they're golden.
  - To make the dressing, put all the ingredients into a blender, give it a whizz and job done!
  - When you patties are cooked, dollop some tahini dressing on each one, then garnish with some coriander and crushed walnuts.
notes:
  - We substituted the tahini with peanut butter and it worked well.
  - Don't skimp on the dressing!
