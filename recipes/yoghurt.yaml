title: "Greek Yoghurt (EasiYo)"
prep_time: "5 minutes (plus 24 hours incubation)"
cook_time: "0 minutes"
servings: "Makes 1kg"
ingredients:
  - Cold tap water
  - 180g full-cream milk powder
  - 3 tbsp greek yoghurt (or 3 tbsp of plain EasiYo Greek yoghurt sachet)
instructions:
  - Gather all ingredients and boil the kettle.
  - In the yoghurt making canister, fill to the halfway mark with cold water. Add the yoghurt starter.
  - Add the milk powder.
  - Place the lid on and shake vigorously until the milk powder is dissolved. Remove the lid and fill to the fill line with more water. Screw the lid on tightly and shake again.
  - Fill the EasiYo yoghurt maker to the fill line with boiling water.
  - Place the canister inside and screw on the yoghurt maker lid. Leave for 24 hours. Remove and refrigerate. Keeps for seven days.
notes:
  - "EasiYo real base and culture is intended for you to use the entire sachet for a batch of yoghurt but using just 2-3 tablespoons is enough if you add extra milk powder. This makes it a lot cheaper."
  - "Store the remainder of the opened base sachet in an airtight container in the refrigerator."
  - "You can use 3 tablespoons from the previous batch of yoghurt as a starter for your next batch."
  - "For sweetened yoghurt, add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar to the canister when mixing in the milk powder and starter."
  - "Some people are happy with yoghurt cultured for 12-14 hours, but 24 hours gives a thick and creamy consistency."
  - "If you don't have an EasiYo, you can use a slow cooker: preheat on low for 30 minutes, turn off, fill with boiling water, place your sealed container with the mixture inside, and incubate as above."
  - "Adjust the amount of milk powder to get your desired thickness. More milk powder = thicker yoghurt."
commentary: "Economical, thick, and creamy Greek yoghurt using EasiYo base and extra milk powder. No straining, no thickeners, no preservatives."
