prep_time: "1 hour"
cook_time: "25 minutes"
servings: "4 (4 pasties)"
ingredients:
  - "For the rough puff pastry:"
  - 300g plain flour
  - A pinch of sea salt
  - 150g chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
  - ""
  - "For the filling:"
  - 25g butter
  - 2-3 medium leeks (about 500g), trimmed and finely sliced
  - 1 teaspoon roughly chopped thyme leaves
  - 150ml double cream
  - 1 teaspoon English mustard
  - About 400g boned chicken thigh and breast meat (or leftover cooked chicken), cut into thick slices
  - 1 tablespoon rapeseed or olive oil (if using fresh chicken)
  - Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - ""
  - "To finish:"
  - 1 medium egg, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon milk, for glazing
instructions:
  - To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt, then add the cubed butter and toss until the pieces are coated with flour. Add just enough iced water (8-10 tablespoons) to bring the mixture together into a fairly firm dough.
  - Shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands and, on a well-floured surface, roll it out in one direction, away from you, so you end up with a rectangle about 1cm thick. Fold the far third towards you, then fold the nearest third over that (rather like folding a business letter), so that you now have a rectangle made up of 3 equal layers. Give the pastry a quarter-turn, then repeat the rolling, folding and turning process 5 more times. Wrap the pastry in a wax wrap or baking paper and rest it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, or up to an hour.
  - To make the filling, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the leeks and thyme, and sweat gently for 5-10 minutes, until the leeks are very tender. Stir in the cream and cook gently for 4-5 minutes to reduce and thicken. Stir in the mustard, season well and leave to cool.
  - If using fresh chicken, season well and fry in the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until evenly browned and cooked through, then leave to cool.
  - Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to about 3mm thick. Using a plate or a cake tin as a template, cut out four 20cm circles; you may have to gather up the trimmings, lay them on top of each other, and re-roll them to get your fourth circle.
  - Spoon the leek mixture on to one half of each circle and pile the chicken on top. Brush the pastry edges with a little water, fold the other half of the pastry over the filling to form a half-moon shape and crimp well to seal.
  - Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the tops of the pasties with beaten egg. Bake in an oven preheated to 190Â°C/Gas Mark 5 for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Eat hot or cold.

commentary: "The pastry from this recipe is amazing BTW. I used it to make beef wellingtons for some friends once and they were dreaming about the pastry months later."
