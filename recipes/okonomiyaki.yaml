ingredients:
  - "40g flour"

  - "1 tbsp bonito flakes"
  - "5g tororo konbu (shaved dried konbu, optional, see notes)"
  - "120g cabbage, shredded"
  - "80g bean sprouts"
  - "2 tbsp tenkasu (fried batter bits, see notes)"

instructions:
  - "Heat a flat griddle pan or frypan to 170°C."
  - "Mix flour and water in a bowl until lump free."
  - "Oil the pan thinly and pour about ¾ of the batter onto the pan, spreading to a 20cm circle."
  - "Turn heat up to 200°C. Spread bonito flakes and tororo konbu (if using) on the batter."
  - "Pile cabbage and bean sprouts within the circle, about 8cm tall. Sprinkle a pinch of salt."
  - "Press down vegetables slightly, add tenkasu and shallots/scallions, then spread pork slices over. Sprinkle salt & pepper."
  - "Cook ~5 mins until edge of batter curves up. Do not move until this point."
  - "Spread remaining batter over the pile to glue toppings together."
  - "Slide spatula under, gently lift and turn over. Collect scattered vegetables and tidy up."
  - "Cook 8-10 mins until cabbage is wilted and soft."
  - "After 6 mins, stir fry noodles on unused area of pan or new frypan at 200°C for a couple of minutes. Shape noodles into a circle matching okonomiyaki diameter."
  - "Lift okonomiyaki and place on top of noodles."
  - "Reduce pan to 170°C. Clean and oil pan."
  - "Crack an egg onto oiled area, break yolk and spread to a circle matching okonomiyaki."
  - "While egg is half raw, lift okonomiyaki and place on egg."
  - "After 10-20 sec, lift and turn over so egg is on top."
  - "Spread okonomiyaki sauce over egg, sprinkle aonori."
  - "Cut in half and serve hot off the pan or transfer to plates."
notes:
  - "Tororo konbu is optional; substitute with shio-konbu or increase bonito flakes to 2 tbsp if unavailable."
  - "Tenkasu are fried bits from tempura; can be bought or collected when making tempura."
  - "Use ready-to-use, boiled fresh, or boiled dried noodles. Cook to al dente or slightly harder."
  - "Okonomiyaki sauce: Mix 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 3 tbsp tomato ketchup, 1 tsp soy sauce, 1 tsp honey, 1/2 tsp dashi stock powder diluted in 1 tsp water (optional)."
  - "Use the back of a ladle to spread batter in a circle."
  - "Cover toppings with pork slices to prevent scattering when flipping."
  - "Use two spatulas if needed for flipping."
  - "If noodles are sticky, add some water."
commentary: "We encountered Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki during our holiday to Japan. We love it and have included it here, but we don't make it that often as it is quite tricky and messy!"
