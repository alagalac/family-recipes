title: "Sausage Rolls"
prep_time: "20 minutes"
cook_time: "30 minutes"
servings: "6"
ingredients:
  - 1 brown onion, finely diced
  - 1 apple, grated
  - 1/2 carrot, grated
  - 500g sausage mince (or regular pork mince)
  - 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
  - 1 egg
  - 3/4 tsp salt
  - 3 sheets puff pastry (thawed if frozen)
  - 2 tbsp milk
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 200°C. Line a baking tray with baking paper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a fry-pan on medium heat. Fry onion, carrot and apple for 3-4 minutes, until softened. Set aside to cool slightly.
  - While vegetables are cooking, in a large bowl combine sausage mince, breadcrumbs, egg, and salt. Add the cooked vegetables and use a wooden spoon to mix well.
  - Place pastry sheets on a flat surface, and cut in half with a sharp knife so you have 2 rectangles with short sides facing you (6 in total).
  - Divide sausage mixture into 6 even portions and mould a portion into a log shape on the bottom third of each pastry piece. Roll pastry and sausage mixture away from you to enclose tightly, with about 2cm overlap of pastry for the seam. Trim off any excess pastry and reserve. Place roll on prepared tray, seam-side down.
  - Brush sausage rolls with milk and bake for 25-30 minutes, until pastry is puffed and golden. Leave to cool on tray for at least 5 minutes before serving.
notes:
  - Use any leftover pastry to make small scrolls. Marmite and cheese works well.
