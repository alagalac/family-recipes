This repo is our family recipes stored in markdown and YAML formats.

Our recipes follow this template. Don't add any extra fields outside of this template.

```yaml
title: ""
prep_time: ""
cook_time: ""
servings: ""
ingredients:
  - 
instructions:
  - 
notes:
  - 
commentary: ""
attribution: ""
```

Note that we support sub-sections in ingredients and instructions. Note that the names in the subsections are used as the heading for that section and so should be correctly capitalised etc.

Do not add numbering to instructions; that is handled by the site generator.

Every recipe must be included in the cookbook_structure.yaml file to be included in the site generation.
