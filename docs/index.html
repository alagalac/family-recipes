<h2>Chicken &amp; Leek Pasties</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">The pastry from this recipe is amazing BTW. I used it to make beef wellingtons for some friends once and they were dreaming about the pastry months later. If there&#x27;s anything you take from this recipe, it&#x27;s the pastry!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4 (4 pasties)</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Rough puff pastry</h4>
<ul>
<li>300g plain flour</li>
<li>A pinch of sea salt</li>
<li>150g chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul>
<li>25g butter</li>
<li>2-3 medium leeks (about 500g), trimmed and finely sliced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon roughly chopped thyme leaves</li>
<li>150ml double cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon English mustard</li>
<li>About 400g boned chicken thigh and breast meat (or leftover cooked chicken), cut into thick slices</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rapeseed or olive oil (if using fresh chicken)</li>
<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h4>To finish</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 medium egg, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon milk, for glazing</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt, then add the cubed butter and toss until the pieces are coated with flour. Add just enough iced water (8-10 tablespoons) to bring the mixture together into a fairly firm dough.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands and, on a well-floured surface, roll it out in one direction, away from you, so you end up with a rectangle about 1cm thick. Fold the far third towards you, then fold the nearest third over that (rather like folding a business letter), so that you now have a rectangle made up of 3 equal layers. Give the pastry a quarter-turn, then repeat the rolling, folding and turning process 5 more times. Wrap the pastry in a wax wrap or baking paper and rest it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, or up to an hour.</li>
<li>To make the filling, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the leeks and thyme, and sweat gently for 5-10 minutes, until the leeks are very tender. Stir in the cream and cook gently for 4-5 minutes to reduce and thicken. Stir in the mustard, season well and leave to cool.</li>
<li>If using fresh chicken, season well and fry in the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until evenly browned and cooked through, then leave to cool.</li>
<li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to about 3mm thick. Using a plate or a cake tin as a template, cut out four 20cm circles; you may have to gather up the trimmings, lay them on top of each other, and re-roll them to get your fourth circle.</li>
<li>Spoon the leek mixture on to one half of each circle and pile the chicken on top. Brush the pastry edges with a little water, fold the other half of the pastry over the filling to form a half-moon shape and crimp well to seal.</li>
<li>Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the tops of the pasties with beaten egg. Bake in an oven preheated to 190°C/Gas Mark 5 for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Eat hot or cold.</li>

<h2>Mini Meatloaves with Carrot Potato Mash</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">The girls really love these mini meatloaves, and they don&#x27;t usually like meat otherwise.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 25 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20-30 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 5</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Meatloaves:</li>
<li>1 brown onion</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 parsnip</li>
<li>450g beef and pork mince</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1 Tbsp gluten-free soy sauce</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

<li>600g potatoes</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
<li>1/4 cup milk</li>
<li>1 Tbsp finely chopped chives</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 220°C. Grease a 12-hole muffin tin (or loaf tin measuring about 25cm x 16cm). Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Bring a full kettle to the boil. Finely dice onion; grate carrot; peel and grate parsnip.</li>
<li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large fry-pan on medium heat. Fry onion, carrot and parsnip about 4 minutes, until tender.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine mince, egg, breadcrumbs, soy sauce, salt, parsley, half the tomato sauce and half the cheese. Season with pepper.</li>
<li>Add cooked vegetables to the bowl with mince mixture. Mix well, using clean hands. Press about 1/4 cup of mixture into the muffin tins. Pack mixture into muffin or loaf tin tightly, so it stays together once baked. Top with remaining tomato sauce and cheese. Bake for 20 minutes (muffin tins) or 30 minutes (loaf tin).</li>
<li>While meatloaves cook, cut potatoes and carrot into 2cm pieces. Cook in pot of boiling water, for about 12-15 minutes, until very soft. Mash with butter, milk, chives and salt, until smooth. Cover, to keep warm.</li>
<li>Set cooked meatloaves aside, to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve with a side of steamed vegetables such as broccoli for a complete meal.</li>
<li>Alternatively just do normal mash potatoes with a bit of wholegrain mustard.</li>

<h2>Spaghetti Meatballs</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Another easy spaghetti recipe.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 20 mins | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20 mins | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>400g beef mince</li>
<li>1 small onion, grated</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>50g breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1 tsp dried mixed herbs</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>400g canned crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>400g spaghetti</li>
<li>20g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the beef mince, grated onion, egg, breadcrumbs, dried mixed herbs, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are combined.</li>
<li>Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about the size of a golf ball. I use a tablespoon scoop to measure and shape them evenly.</li>
<li>Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add a little oil. Cook the meatballs in batches, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through (about 10-12 minutes). Remove the meatballs from the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>In the same pan, add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the canned crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes to thicken slightly. Add salt to season.</li>
<li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, saving a little pasta water.</li>
<li>Return the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for another 5 minutes to let the flavors meld together, adding a splash of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.</li>
<li>Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese before serving.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pork mince (or a pork-beef mix) also works well in this recipe.</li>

<h2>Baked Mac and Cheese</h2>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Servings:</strong> </div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Macaroni</h4>
<ul>
<li>250g / 8 oz macaroni (elbow pasta)</li>
<li>1 tbsp (15g) unsalted butter (or 2 tsp oil)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Topping</h4>
<ul>
<li>2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li>4 tbsp (60g) unsalted butter</li>
<li>1/3 cup plain / all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 cups milk, warmed (low or full fat)</li>
<li>2 cups freshly shredded cheese (Gruyere recommended)</li>
<li>1 cup freshly shredded mozzarella (or more cheese of choice)</li>
<li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Seasonings (optional)</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp mustard powder</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180°C.</li>
<li>Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet directions, but reduce cooking time by 1 minute (cook &#x27;al dente&#x27;). Drain well.</li>
<li>Toss in butter: Return drained pasta to the pot, add 1 tbsp butter and toss until melted and coating each piece. Set aside while you make the sauce (this helps stop the pasta swelling and becoming stodgy).</li>
<li>Make the topping: Combine panko breadcrumbs, melted butter and 1/4 tsp salt in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
<li>Make the sauce (roux method): In a large saucepan or ovenproof skillet, melt 4 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to make a roux.</li>
<li>Add milk: Add about 1 cup of warmed milk, whisk to dissolve the roux, then add remaining milk and whisk until smooth and lump-free.</li>
<li>Season and thicken: Add salt and any optional seasonings. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5-8 minutes until the sauce thickens to a cream consistency (it should coat the back of a spoon).</li>
<li>Add cheese: Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the shredded cheeses - they don&#x27;t need to fully melt on the stove. Taste and adjust salt.</li>
<li>Assemble: Pour the cheese sauce into the pot with the butter-coated macaroni and stir quickly to combine. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish or keep in an ovenproof skillet. Sprinkle the breadcrumb topping evenly over the surface.</li>
<li>Bake: Bake at 180°C for about 25 minutes, or until the top is light golden and the sauce is bubbly. Do not overbake or the dish will dry out.</li>
<li>Serve: Remove from oven and serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Grate your own cheese for best results — pre-grated cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can make sauces grainy.</li>
<li>Tossing the cooked pasta with butter before adding sauce prevents the pasta from swelling and keeps the final dish saucy rather than stodgy.</li>
<li>This recipe reheats well; reheat gently and consider adding a splash of milk if the sauce has thickened in the fridge.</li>
<li>Make-ahead: Assemble without the breadcrumb topping, refrigerate, add breadcrumbs just before baking and bake until hot and golden.</li>

<h2>Gnocchi</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">I really love this recipe. I&#x27;ve made it a couple of times for my parents and it&#x27;s never failed to impress.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 30 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 1 hour 15 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Gnocchi</h4>
<ul>
<li>700-800g agria potatoes, scrubbed (leave the skin on the potatoes)</li>
<li>1 free-range egg</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>150g &#x27;00&#x27; Italian flour (or plain flour)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tomato Basil Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
<li>1 400g can Italian crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1 generous handful basil leaves</li>
<li>150g fresh cow&#x27;s mozzarella (or shredded/grated mozzarella)</li>
<li>1 small handful parmesan, grated</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 200°C. Place whole potatoes on an oven tray and bake for about 1 hour (depending on the size of potatoes) until very tender - test with a skewer or tip of a sharp knife; it should poke right through with no resistance.</li>
<li>Cut potatoes in half and peel off the skins while still warm. Push warm potato flesh through a potato ricer or a sieve (with the help of the back of a large spoon) into a large bowl. This ensures light gnocchi; whatever you do, do not mash the potato.</li>
<li>Add egg and salt and mix in with a fork. Sift in flour and use your hands to bring together as a soft dough. Add a little more flour if needed - it should feel dry to the touch, but not crumbly. Knead a few times, then divide into six pieces.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece out into a log about 30cm long, then cut into bite-sized 2cm pieces. Gently push the tip of your thumb or finger into the centre of each piece to make a little indent (this makes the perfect little hollow for sauce to pool in). Place in a large dish or on a tray (with a lip) dusted with flour, and shake pieces around to coat. Set aside until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to the boil and preheat oven to grill. While water is coming to the boil, make the sauce. Heat olive oil in a large heatproof fry pan on medium heat. Sizzle garlic for 1-2 minutes (but do not let it brown), then stir in crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 5-8 minutes until thickened, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir through basil.</li>
<li>Drop about half of the gnocchi (one by one) into the boiling water and cook for a couple of minutes, scooping them out with a slotted spoon as they bob to the surface. Transfer straight into the pan of hot tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Once all the gnocchi are in the pan, gently toss to coat in sauce and top with mozzarella and parmesan. Place under the oven grill for about 5 minutes or until sauce is bubbling and mozzarella is melted. Serve immediately.</li>

<li>If using chicken breast, cut in half horizontally to create two steaks.</li>
<li>Place the protein of choice on a work surface and cover with baking paper or cling wrap. Use a rolling pin to pound to even thickness about 0.8 cm thick (don&#x27;t pound too thin, hard to handle / might tear).</li>

<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Patties</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 sweet potatoes, skin on, washed, and roughly chopped</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>400g (2 cups) quinoa, rinsed</li>
<li>1/2 red onion, finely chopped</li>

<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>Juice and zest of 1 lime</li>
<li>1/2 bunch coriander (save some leaves for serving)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180°C.</li>
<li>Arrange sweet potato pieces on a baking tray, drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and bake for 20 minutes. At the same time put 750ml (3 cups) of water and the quinoa in a saucepan over a medium-high heat, bring it to the boil, then simmer for 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and all the liquid is gone.</li>
<li>When the spuds are cooked, pop them into a large mixing bowl, add your cooked quinoa and use a fork to mash everything together. Add the onion, garlic, cumin, and fresh chilli to the mix and season with salt and pepper. Shape the mixture into 8 large balls (you want these to look like little burger patties). Place the patties on a baking tray, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and bake for 15 minutes, or until they&#x27;re golden.</li>
<li>To make the dressing, put all the ingredients into a blender, give it a whizz and job done!</li>
<li>When you patties are cooked, dollop some tahini dressing on each one, then garnish with some coriander and crushed walnuts.</li>

<ul>
<li>Many burger recipes use eggs to keep the patties together, but I find them unnecessary.</li>
<li>I sometimes like to mix in mum&#x27;s feijoa BBQ sauce to the patties, but the sugars in this does mean the patties can burn more easily.</li>
<li>This works best with beef mince that has fat in it (so not the premium mince). But get good mince from the butcher.</li>

<ul>
<li>1 packet pita bread, each cut into 8 triangles</li>

<li>Meanwhile heat a splash of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until softened and translucent.</li>
<li>Add the beef mince (or cooked brown lentils). Season with salt and pepper and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes).</li>

<li>If using avocado and fresh tomato as toppings, prepare them now: dice tomato and mash the avocado; squeeze a little lemon or lime over the avocado to prevent browning.</li>

<h2>Steak and Chips</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Lots of people don&#x27;t know how to cook steak, and just chuck it on the BBQ with no seasoning. I cooked steak for some of my friends using this method some of my friends said it was the best steak they&#x27;d ever had.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 40 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>

<h4>Steak and Chips</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 big scotch fillet steaks (aim for 125g per person)</li>
<li>1 kg potatoes (for chips)</li>
<li>1 bunch green vegetables (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, etc.)</li>

<li>Serve the steaks with the chips and your choice of sauce.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The key to cooking steak is to firstly let it come to room temperature before cooking, secondly to season it with salt 5 minutes before cooking, and thirdly to let it rest for 5 minutes after cooking.</li>
<li>Easier than making chips, we often just roast chopped potatoes.</li>
<li>You can use other cuts of steak, but scotch fillet is my favourite.</li>

<h2>Chicken &amp; Leek Pasties</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">The pastry from this recipe is amazing BTW. I used it to make beef wellingtons for some friends once and they were dreaming about the pastry months later. If there&#x27;s anything you take from this recipe, it&#x27;s the pastry!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4 (4 pasties)</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Rough puff pastry</h4>
<ul>
<li>300g plain flour</li>
<li>A pinch of sea salt</li>
<li>150g chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul>
<li>25g butter</li>
<li>2-3 medium leeks (about 500g), trimmed and finely sliced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon roughly chopped thyme leaves</li>
<li>150ml double cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon English mustard</li>
<li>About 400g boned chicken thigh and breast meat (or leftover cooked chicken), cut into thick slices</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rapeseed or olive oil (if using fresh chicken)</li>
<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h4>To finish</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 medium egg, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon milk, for glazing</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt, then add the cubed butter and toss until the pieces are coated with flour. Add just enough iced water (8-10 tablespoons) to bring the mixture together into a fairly firm dough.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands and, on a well-floured surface, roll it out in one direction, away from you, so you end up with a rectangle about 1cm thick. Fold the far third towards you, then fold the nearest third over that (rather like folding a business letter), so that you now have a rectangle made up of 3 equal layers. Give the pastry a quarter-turn, then repeat the rolling, folding and turning process 5 more times. Wrap the pastry in a wax wrap or baking paper and rest it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, or up to an hour.</li>
<li>To make the filling, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the leeks and thyme, and sweat gently for 5-10 minutes, until the leeks are very tender. Stir in the cream and cook gently for 4-5 minutes to reduce and thicken. Stir in the mustard, season well and leave to cool.</li>
<li>If using fresh chicken, season well and fry in the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until evenly browned and cooked through, then leave to cool.</li>
<li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to about 3mm thick. Using a plate or a cake tin as a template, cut out four 20cm circles; you may have to gather up the trimmings, lay them on top of each other, and re-roll them to get your fourth circle.</li>
<li>Spoon the leek mixture on to one half of each circle and pile the chicken on top. Brush the pastry edges with a little water, fold the other half of the pastry over the filling to form a half-moon shape and crimp well to seal.</li>
<li>Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the tops of the pasties with beaten egg. Bake in an oven preheated to 190°C/Gas Mark 5 for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Eat hot or cold.</li>

<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 1 hour 30 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 15-20 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 1 loaf</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or 1 teaspoon dried</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 cup (235 ml) warm water</li>
<li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon honey</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a cold medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and the black pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes or until aromatic, but before the garlic browns. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. Once the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead the dough 10 to 15 times until smooth. Transfer to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. (It’s best to let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen).</li>
<li>After 1 hour, heat oven to 450°F (230°C). Use two tablespoons of the remaining garlic-olive oil mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the garlic-olive oil mixture. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly.</li>
<li>Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia bread on a wire rack.</li>

<li>Rest pancake batter for 20 minutes and you&#x27;ll get a lighter pancake.</li>
<li>Always weigh out your ingredients. Too much flour and not enough milk will result in a dense pancake.</li>
<li>When frying, use an equal mix of butter and oil - using just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. The butter helps with flavour and the oil stops the butter from burning.</li>
<li>Flip your pancake when the edges look set and dry.</li>
<li>And only flip your pancake once - otherwise it will be tough.</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t worry if the first pancake doesn&#x27;t come out right - use it to test the temperature of the pan and adjust accordingly.</li>

<h2>Self-saucing Chocolate Pudding</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Growing up, Aunty Barbara&#x27;s self-saucing chocolate pudding was a family favourite. This recipe is very similar, but with less sugar and more cocoa powder!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 35 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Pudding</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 cup self raising flour (150g)</li>
<li>3 Tbsp cocoa powder</li>
<li>½ cup brown sugar (100g)</li>
<li>80g butter, melted and cooled</li>
<li>½ cup milk (125ml)</li>
<li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
<li>Vanilla ice cream or cream, to serve</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li>¾ cup brown sugar (150g)</li>
<li>2 Tbsp cocoa powder, sifted</li>
<li>1 ¼ cups boiling water (313ml)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180°C bake (160°C fan-forced). Grease a 6-cup capacity ovenproof baking dish.</li>
<li>Sift self raising flour and cocoa into a large bowl. Stir in the brown sugar.</li>
<li>Whisk butter, milk and egg in a jug. Slowly add to flour mixture, stirring until well combined and smooth. Spoon into baking dish and smooth the top.</li>
<li>For the sauce combine the brown sugar and cocoa and sprinkle over the pudding. Slowly pour the boiling water over the back of a large metal spoon to cover pudding. Place dish onto a baking tray and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until pudding bounces back when pressed gently in the centre.</li>
<li>Serve hot with vanilla ice cream or cream.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>A dry self saucing pudding usually means it was overbaked or didn&#x27;t have enough boiling water added. To keep it saucy, measure liquids carefully and bake until the sponge is just set. Don&#x27;t overcook!</li>
<li>You can prepare the batter and topping ahead of time, but it&#x27;s best to bake self saucing pudding just before serving. Add the hot water and bake fresh so the sauce stays warm and gooey.</li>

<ul>
<li>3 egg yolks</li>
<li>1/4 cup caster sugar (56g)</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
<li>250g mascarpone</li>
<li>300ml cream</li>

<li>24 large sponge fingers or savoiardi biscuits</li>
<li>1-2 Tbsp cocoa powder</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a double boiler by bringing a few centimetres of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Place a glass or stainless steel bowl over the top, so that it fits snugly without touching the water below.</li>
<li>Place egg yolks, caster sugar and vanilla in the bowl. Whisk until thick, pale and creamy (3-4 minutes). Remove from heat.</li>
<li>Place the mascarpone and cream in a separate large bowl. Using an electric mixer, whip to soft peaks. Fold into the egg mixture.</li>
<li>Mix the coffee with the coffee liqueur. Dunk the sponge fingers quickly in the coffee mixture, making sure they are completely immersed. Don&#x27;t leave them in for more than a second or two as they can turn soggy.</li>
<li>Layer one third of the sponge fingers in a serving dish (approximately 24cm x 16cm) and top with a third of the mascarpone cream. Repeat twice to form three layers.</li>
<li>Sift cocoa evenly over the top. Cover and chill for at least 3 hours before serving.</li>

<ul>
<li>To save time you can substitute the egg yolk mixture with 1 cup (250g) of store-bought custard.</li>
<li>Blend the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone before you fold in the whipped cream and it will come out perfectly fluffy</li>

<h4>Ganache (shiny chocolate icing)</h4>
<ul>
<li>250g good-quality dark chocolate, broken into small chunks</li>
<li>125g unsalted butter</li>
<li>50ml water</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Cake</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 180C. Butter a 23cm springform tin and line the base with buttered baking paper. Dust the tin with flour (or rice flour if you&#x27;re avoiding wheat completely), and tap out the excess. Set it aside.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan over low heat. Add the chocolate and whisk it in until it&#x27;s melted too. Take the pan off the heat, then add the cocoa, stirring it in until the mixture is thick and smooth. Set it aside to cool a little.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, whiz the pecans in a food processor to chop them as finely as possible. Keep an eye on them as you do this, stopping the machine every so often to check them so they don’t become oily and form a paste. Set them aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar with a balloon whisk until they&#x27;re just blended together, then whisk in the warm chocolate mixture until it&#x27;s well combined. Mix in the brandy and vanilla extract. Finally, stir in the ground pecans – at this stage the batter looks very loose and sloppy but that’s just how it should be.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Pop it in the oven and bake the cake for 40-45 minutes or until the sides are set but the middle 15cm or so of the cake is still a bit wobbly when you gently shake the tin.</li>
<li>Remove it to a wire rack and leave the cake to cool completely in the tin. Once cool, release the sides of the tin and carefully invert the cake onto a plate lined with baking paper. Cover the cake with plastic wrap, and chill it in the fridge, where it keeps well for at least a week.</li>
<li>When you&#x27;re ready to eat it, slide the cake off the baking paper onto a serving dish then dust it with icing sugar. Serve it with cream.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Ganache (shiny chocolate icing)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Makes about 1 3/4 cups - enough to ice 2 medium-sized cakes</li>
<li>Ganache is lovely stuff and terribly easy to make. There are lots of different versions of it (many use cream rather than butter), but basically whatever recipe you use, you end up with a silky, chocolate glaze that forms a glossy icing when it’s poured over a cake.</li>
<li>Put the chocolate, butter and water into a medium-sized, heavy-based saucepan over low heat. Let the chocolate and butter melt, stirring the mixture frequently, until the ganache is smooth. (I use a small, flat sauce whisk for this, as it gets right into the corners of the pan where the chocolate tends to clump a bit.) The most important thing to keep in mind when you’re making ganache is that it mustn’t get too hot and boil – if it does, it becomes oily and grainy and there’s not much chance of salvaging it, I’m afraid. Once it’s silky smooth, take it off the heat and let it cool until it’s barely warm and of a thick pouring consistency. Pour as much as you need evenly over the cake so it trickles down the sides. Leave the ganache to set</li>
<li>Scrape any leftover ganache into an airtight container, seal it tightly and store it in the fridge. When you&#x27;re ready to use it, gently warm it over very low heat, then let it cool to the right consistency. It’s wonderful to have on hand when you want to dress up a cake in a hurry, as all you need do is swoosh some ganache over it and it immediately looks chic and special.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dutch-processed cocoa removes some of the cocoa&#x27;s acidity, giving it a softer, smoother flavour, richer colour, and tends to dissolve more easily. Usually available in good delicatessens and specialty food shops.</li>
<li>This is a dense, rich and very chocolate-y cake that dissolves on your tongue, leaving a hint of dark, bitter-sweet warmth.</li>
<li>Ganache sets beautifully most of the time, but like all chocolate, it&#x27;s a bit temperamental in hot, humid weather. If it won&#x27;t set and is still sticky, put the ganache-coated cake, uncovered, in the fridge for a short time so the quick burst of chilled air sets it.</li>
<li>In hot, humid weather, store the cake in the fridge. Put the cake uncovered in the fridge until the ganache has set, then cover it in plastic wrap. Before serving, remove the wrap and return the cake to cool room temperature so the ganache regains its sheen.</li>
<li>Ganache makes about 1 3/4 cups - enough to ice 2 medium-sized cakes.</li>

<li>4 eggs, separated (Size 7)</li>
<li>10ml vanilla essence</li>
<li>Ground cinnamon, to sprinkle</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a 25cm pie dish with grease spray.</li>
<li>For the smear crust: Cream 100g softened salted butter and 100g granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add 2 eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Fold in 100g plain flour until the mixture is well combined.</li>
<li>Using your fingers, smear a very thin, even layer of the mixture over the base and sides of the prepared pie dish. Use a light touch so the mixture distributes evenly; this forms a delicate thin crust. If you have extra mixture, freeze for later use.</li>
<li>For the filling: Preheat the oven to 160°C (fan or conventional equivalent). Put 600ml milk into a pot and warm over medium-low heat until scalding (just below boiling).</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 150ml milk, 150g granulated sugar, 50g plain flour, 50g cornflour and 2g salt into a smooth, lump-free paste.</li>
<li>While stirring, gradually add the hot scalded milk to the paste to temper it, then return the combined mixture to the pot. Heat over medium-low, stirring continuously, until the mixture reaches its first boil and forms a thick plop (bubbles).</li>
<li>Transfer the hot milk mixture to a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk the 4 egg yolks and whisk them into the warm milk mixture. Add 100g salted butter and 10ml vanilla essence and stir until combined; the butter will melt into the warm custard. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
<li>In a clean bowl, whip the 4 egg whites to stiff peaks (but not dry).</li>
<li>Once the milk mixture has cooled to warm (not hot), fold the whipped egg whites gently into the milk mixture until just combined.</li>
<li>Pour the filling gently into the prepared smear crust, smoothing the top. Sprinkle generously with ground cinnamon.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is set and slightly golden.</li>
<li>Serve warm from the oven or chilled from the fridge (many prefer chilled).</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>All eggs used in this recipe are Size 7 (large).</li>
<li>The smear crust recipe may give extra; leftover crust freezes well.</li>

<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>A great way to use up excess feijoas!</li>
<li>Some feijoa varieties are much sweeter and juicier than others, so your chutney may vary from one batch to the next. We have reduced the vinegar in this recipe from 1 litre to 750ml, but you may wish to try it after it has cooked for an hour and adjust the flavour balance to suit your taste.</li>
<li>The cooking time will vary depending on the juiciness of your feijoas and the size of your pot. If you are making a double batch it will take even longer to reduce.</li>

<h2>Greek Yoghurt (EasiYo)</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Economical, thick, and creamy Greek yoghurt using EasiYo base and extra milk powder. No straining, no thickeners, no preservatives.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 5 minutes (plus 24 hours incubation) | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 0 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> Makes 1kg</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cold tap water</li>
<li>180g full-cream milk powder</li>
<li>3 tbsp greek yoghurt (or 3 tbsp of plain EasiYo Greek yoghurt sachet)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Gather all ingredients and boil the kettle.</li>
<li>In the yoghurt making canister, fill to the halfway mark with cold water. Add the yoghurt starter.</li>
<li>Add the milk powder.</li>
<li>Place the lid on and shake vigorously until the milk powder is dissolved. Remove the lid and fill to the fill line with more water. Screw the lid on tightly and shake again.</li>
<li>Fill the EasiYo yoghurt maker to the fill line with boiling water.</li>
<li>Place the canister inside and screw on the yoghurt maker lid. Leave for 24 hours. Remove and refrigerate. Keeps for seven days.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>EasiYo real base and culture is intended for you to use the entire sachet for a batch of yoghurt but using just 2-3 tablespoons is enough if you add extra milk powder. This makes it a lot cheaper.</li>
<li>Store the remainder of the opened base sachet in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>You can use 3 tablespoons from the previous batch of yoghurt as a starter for your next batch.</li>
<li>For sweetened yoghurt, add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar to the canister when mixing in the milk powder and starter.</li>
<li>Some people are happy with yoghurt cultured for 12-14 hours, but 24 hours gives a thick and creamy consistency.</li>
<li>If you don&#x27;t have an EasiYo, you can use a slow cooker: preheat on low for 30 minutes, turn off, fill with boiling water, place your sealed container with the mixture inside, and incubate as above.</li>
<li>Adjust the amount of milk powder to get your desired thickness. More milk powder = thicker yoghurt.</li>

<h2>Christmas Cookies</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">We made these cookies for Lexie&#x27;s Playcentre graduation and they were a hit with the kids.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 2 hours | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 13 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 40 cookies</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<ul>
<li>225g butter, softened (or Olivani Spread)</li>
<li>¾ cup Chelsea White Sugar (170g)</li>
<li>1½ tsp vanilla essence</li>
<li>¼ tsp salt</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>2 cups plain flour (300g)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Royal Icing</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 egg whites</li>
<li>1 tsp lemon juice (strained to remove any pulp)</li>
<li>3½ cups Chelsea Icing Sugar (525g)</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<ol>
<li>Using an electric mixer, beat butter and Chelsea White Sugar together until pale and creamy, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.</li>
<li>Beat in vanilla and salt. Add egg and beat well.</li>
<li>Slowly add the flour and mix until just combined.</li>
<li>Place some cling film on the bench and tip the mixture into this. Slightly flatten into an oval shape. Wrap up well and refrigerate for at least two hours.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 160°C and line two baking trays with baking paper.</li>
<li>Split the dough into two portions to make it easier to work with. Knead the dough gently using well-floured hands, then on a well-floured bench, roll the dough to the desired thickness (5mm works well).</li>
<li>Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes and carefully transfer to prepared trays.</li>
<li>Continue to create shapes, kneading the dough scraps back together, until all dough is used.</li>
<li>Bake for 13-15 minutes, until pale golden. Keep an eye on them from about 12 minutes, to ensure they don&#x27;t brown too much.</li>
<li>Cool on trays for 3 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Royal Icing</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the egg whites and lemon juice in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.</li>
<li>Add the Chelsea Icing Sugar one cup at a time, mixing well in between with electric beaters, until fully incorporated. Add the last ½ cup a little at a time, until you reach soft peaks (you may not need to use all of it).</li>
<li>You can test for the correct consistency of icing by dragging a knife over the surface. If the surface smoothes over in approximately 10 seconds, the icing is at the right consistency. Mix in water in very small quantities, until this consistency is achieved.</li>
<li>Split the icing into small bowls if you wish to make different colours. Add food colour if desired (gel colours work best).</li>
<li>Spoon into ziplock plastic bags or piping bags fitted with small round piping tips, ready for icing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively use a simple icing sugar and milk icing instead.</li>

<h2>Yorkshire Puddings</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Classic British side, crisp and hollow, perfect for roast dinners.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 35 minutes (including resting) | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 15-25 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 12 standard muffin sized puddings</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>150g all-purpose flour</li>
<li>175g whole milk</li>
<li>25g water</li>
<li>2g kosher salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)</li>
<li>100ml beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For best results, refrigerate batter overnight or up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while preheating oven.</li>
<li>Adjust oven rack to centre position and preheat oven to 230°C. Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins, one 12-well standard muffin tin, or one 24-well mini muffin tin. Preheat in oven until fat is smoking hot, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer pans or tins to a heat-proof surface and divide batter evenly between every well (or between pans if using pans). Wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (or 1/4 for pans). Immediately return to oven. Bake until puddings have quadrupled in volume, are deep brown, crisp, and sound hollow when tapped. Smaller ones take about 15 minutes, popover/skillet-sized about 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resting the batter overnight improves results.</li>
<li>Can use beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil.</li>
<li>For best rise, ensure fat is smoking hot before adding batter.</li>
