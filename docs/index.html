<h2>Chicken &amp; Leek Pasties</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">The pastry from this recipe is amazing BTW. I used it to make beef wellingtons for some friends once and they were dreaming about the pastry months later. If there&#x27;s anything you take from this recipe, it&#x27;s the pastry!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4 (4 pasties)</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Rough puff pastry</h4>
<ul>
<li>300g plain flour</li>
<li>A pinch of sea salt</li>
<li>150g chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul>
<li>25g butter</li>
<li>2-3 medium leeks (about 500g), trimmed and finely sliced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon roughly chopped thyme leaves</li>
<li>150ml double cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon English mustard</li>
<li>About 400g boned chicken thigh and breast meat (or leftover cooked chicken), cut into thick slices</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rapeseed or olive oil (if using fresh chicken)</li>
<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h4>To finish</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 medium egg, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon milk, for glazing</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt, then add the cubed butter and toss until the pieces are coated with flour. Add just enough iced water (8-10 tablespoons) to bring the mixture together into a fairly firm dough.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands and, on a well-floured surface, roll it out in one direction, away from you, so you end up with a rectangle about 1cm thick. Fold the far third towards you, then fold the nearest third over that (rather like folding a business letter), so that you now have a rectangle made up of 3 equal layers. Give the pastry a quarter-turn, then repeat the rolling, folding and turning process 5 more times. Wrap the pastry in a wax wrap or baking paper and rest it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, or up to an hour.</li>
<li>To make the filling, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the leeks and thyme, and sweat gently for 5-10 minutes, until the leeks are very tender. Stir in the cream and cook gently for 4-5 minutes to reduce and thicken. Stir in the mustard, season well and leave to cool.</li>
<li>If using fresh chicken, season well and fry in the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until evenly browned and cooked through, then leave to cool.</li>
<li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to about 3mm thick. Using a plate or a cake tin as a template, cut out four 20cm circles; you may have to gather up the trimmings, lay them on top of each other, and re-roll them to get your fourth circle.</li>
<li>Spoon the leek mixture on to one half of each circle and pile the chicken on top. Brush the pastry edges with a little water, fold the other half of the pastry over the filling to form a half-moon shape and crimp well to seal.</li>
<li>Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the tops of the pasties with beaten egg. Bake in an oven preheated to 190°C/Gas Mark 5 for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Eat hot or cold.</li>

<h2>Mini Meatloaves with Carrot Potato Mash</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">The girls really love these mini meatloaves, and they don&#x27;t usually like meat otherwise.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 25 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20-30 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 5</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Meatloaves:</li>
<li>1 brown onion</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 parsnip</li>
<li>450g beef and pork mince</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1 Tbsp gluten-free soy sauce</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>2 Tbsp chopped parsley</li>
<li>1/4 cup tomato sauce</li>
<li>1 cup grated cheese</li>
<li>Mash:</li>
<li>600g potatoes</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
<li>1/4 cup milk</li>
<li>1 Tbsp finely chopped chives</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 220°C. Grease a 12-hole muffin tin (or loaf tin measuring about 25cm x 16cm). Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Bring a full kettle to the boil. Finely dice onion; grate carrot; peel and grate parsnip.</li>
<li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large fry-pan on medium heat. Fry onion, carrot and parsnip about 4 minutes, until tender.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine mince, egg, breadcrumbs, soy sauce, salt, parsley, half the tomato sauce and half the cheese. Season with pepper.</li>
<li>Add cooked vegetables to the bowl with mince mixture. Mix well, using clean hands. Press about 1/4 cup of mixture into the muffin tins. Pack mixture into muffin or loaf tin tightly, so it stays together once baked. Top with remaining tomato sauce and cheese. Bake for 20 minutes (muffin tins) or 30 minutes (loaf tin).</li>
<li>While meatloaves cook, cut potatoes and carrot into 2cm pieces. Cook in pot of boiling water, for about 12-15 minutes, until very soft. Mash with butter, milk, chives and salt, until smooth. Cover, to keep warm.</li>
<li>Set cooked meatloaves aside, to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Serve with a side of steamed vegetables such as broccoli for a complete meal.</li>
<li>Alternatively just do normal mash potatoes with a bit of wholegrain mustard.</li>

<h2>Pita Nachos</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">We find a lot of the corn chips are too salty, so we prefer to make our own pita chips. They get super crispy.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 5 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 packet pita bread, each cut into 8 triangles</li>
<li>1 onion, diced</li>
<li>500g beef mince, or brown lentils for vegetarian</li>
<li>1 tin tomatoes (400g)</li>
<li>1 tin black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>2 tbsp taco seasoning (or mix 1 tsp each ground cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and a pinch of cayenne pepper)</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1 tomato, diced</li>
<li>1/4 cup grated cheese</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 200°C (fan 180°C). Line a baking tray with baking paper.</li>
<li>Prepare the pita chips: lightly brush or spray pita triangles with oil, spread in a single layer on the tray and bake 8-12 minutes until crisp and golden. Remove and set aside.</li>
<li>Meanwhile heat a splash of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until softened and translucent.</li>
<li>Add the beef mince (or cooked brown lentils). Season with salt and pepper and cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes).</li>
<li>Stir in the tin of tomatoes, beans, and taco seasoning (or spice mix). Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and cook gently for 10-15 minutes until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
<li>If using avocado and fresh tomato as toppings, prepare them now: dice tomato and mash the avocado; squeeze a little lemon or lime over the avocado to prevent browning.</li>
<li>To assemble: scatter the pita chips on a serving platter or divide between plates, spoon the mince mixture over the chips, then top with grated cheese, diced tomato, avocado and other toppings such as olives, sour cream or salsa.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can use regur corn chips (we prefer the mexicano natural ones), but we like the pita chips better.</li>

<ol>
<li>Place the beef mince, grated onion, egg, breadcrumbs, dried mixed herbs, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are combined.</li>
<li>Shape the mixture into small meatballs, about the size of a golf ball. I use a tablespoon scoop to measure and shape them evenly.</li>
<li>Heat a large frying pan over medium heat and add a little oil. Cook the meatballs in batches, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through (about 10-12 minutes). Remove the meatballs from the pan and set aside.</li>
<li>In the same pan, add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the canned crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes to thicken slightly. Add salt to season.</li>
<li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, saving a little pasta water.</li>
<li>Return the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for another 5 minutes to let the flavors meld together, adding a splash of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.</li>
<li>Serve the meatballs and sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese before serving.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pork mince (or a pork-beef mix) also works well in this recipe.</li>
<li>For extra vegetables, add a grated carrot or courgette to the sauce.</li>
<li>If available, fresh herbs work well in the meatball mixture instead of dried.</li>

<li>Toss in butter: Return drained pasta to the pot, add 1 tbsp butter and toss until melted and coating each piece. Set aside while you make the sauce (this helps stop the pasta swelling and becoming stodgy).</li>
<li>Make the topping: Combine panko breadcrumbs, melted butter and 1/4 tsp salt in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
<li>Make the sauce (roux method): In a large saucepan or ovenproof skillet, melt 4 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to make a roux.</li>
<li>Add milk: Add about 1 cup of warmed milk, whisk to dissolve the roux, then add remaining milk and whisk until smooth and lump-free.</li>
<li>Season and thicken: Add salt and any optional seasonings. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5-8 minutes until the sauce thickens to a cream consistency (it should coat the back of a spoon).</li>
<li>Add cheese: Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the shredded cheeses - they don&#x27;t need to fully melt on the stove. Taste and adjust salt.</li>
<li>Assemble: Pour the cheese sauce into the pot with the butter-coated macaroni and stir quickly to combine. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish or keep in an ovenproof skillet. Sprinkle the breadcrumb topping evenly over the surface.</li>
<li>Bake: Bake at 180°C for about 25 minutes, or until the top is light golden and the sauce is bubbly. Do not overbake or the dish will dry out.</li>
<li>Serve: Remove from oven and serve immediately, garnished with chopped parsley if desired.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Grate your own cheese for best results — pre-grated cheese often contains anti-caking agents that can make sauces grainy.</li>
<li>Tossing the cooked pasta with butter before adding sauce prevents the pasta from swelling and keeps the final dish saucy rather than stodgy.</li>
<li>This recipe reheats well; reheat gently and consider adding a splash of milk if the sauce has thickened in the fridge.</li>
<li>Make-ahead: Assemble without the breadcrumb topping, refrigerate, add breadcrumbs just before baking and bake until hot and golden.</li>

<h2>Gnocchi</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">I really love this recipe. I&#x27;ve made it a couple of times for my parents and it&#x27;s never failed to impress.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 30 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 1 hour 15 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Gnocchi</h4>
<ul>
<li>700-800g agria potatoes, scrubbed (leave the skin on the potatoes)</li>
<li>1 free-range egg</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>150g &#x27;00&#x27; Italian flour (or plain flour)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tomato Basil Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
<li>1 400g can Italian crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1 generous handful basil leaves</li>
<li>150g fresh cow&#x27;s mozzarella (or shredded/grated mozzarella)</li>
<li>1 small handful parmesan, grated</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 200°C. Place whole potatoes on an oven tray and bake for about 1 hour (depending on the size of potatoes) until very tender - test with a skewer or tip of a sharp knife; it should poke right through with no resistance.</li>
<li>Cut potatoes in half and peel off the skins while still warm. Push warm potato flesh through a potato ricer or a sieve (with the help of the back of a large spoon) into a large bowl. This ensures light gnocchi; whatever you do, do not mash the potato.</li>
<li>Add egg and salt and mix in with a fork. Sift in flour and use your hands to bring together as a soft dough. Add a little more flour if needed - it should feel dry to the touch, but not crumbly. Knead a few times, then divide into six pieces.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece out into a log about 30cm long, then cut into bite-sized 2cm pieces. Gently push the tip of your thumb or finger into the centre of each piece to make a little indent (this makes the perfect little hollow for sauce to pool in). Place in a large dish or on a tray (with a lip) dusted with flour, and shake pieces around to coat. Set aside until ready to cook.</li>
<li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to the boil and preheat oven to grill. While water is coming to the boil, make the sauce. Heat olive oil in a large heatproof fry pan on medium heat. Sizzle garlic for 1-2 minutes (but do not let it brown), then stir in crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 5-8 minutes until thickened, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir through basil.</li>
<li>Drop about half of the gnocchi (one by one) into the boiling water and cook for a couple of minutes, scooping them out with a slotted spoon as they bob to the surface. Transfer straight into the pan of hot tomato sauce.</li>

<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 15 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>

<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Pick one</h4>
<ul>
<li>600g boneless pork (4 steaks / boneless chops, about 150g each)</li>
<li>600g large chicken breasts (2 pieces, 300g each)</li>
<li>600g veal or beef steaks (4 pieces, 150g each)</li>

<h4>Schnitzel Coating</h4>
<ul>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>3/4 cup flour</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Oil for frying (canola, vegetable)</li>

<h4>To serve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Mashed potato</li>
<li>Steamed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, green beans)</li>
<li>Horseradish sauce (if using beef or veal)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>If using chicken breast, cut in half horizontally to create two steaks.</li>
<li>Place the protein of choice on a work surface and cover with baking paper or cling wrap. Use a rolling pin to pound to even thickness about 0.8 cm thick (don&#x27;t pound too thin, hard to handle / might tear).</li>
<li>Sprinkle both sides of meat with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Place flour in one dish, panko in another, and whisk eggs in a bowl.</li>
<li>Coat meat in flour, shake off excess. Dip into egg, shake off excess. Press into breadcrumbs, and turn, pressing to adhere, then transfer to plate. Repeat for all pieces.</li>
<li>Heat 1.5cm oil in a heavy based deep skillet over medium high heat.</li>
<li>Dip the end of a schnitzel in to check if the oil is hot enough - it should sizzle straight away.</li>
<li>Carefully place 2 schnitzels in the oil and cook for 3 minutes until deep golden, turn then cook the other side for 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining schnitzel.</li>
<li>Serve with lemon wedges. Optionally serve with mushroom gravy or potato rosti.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>This recipe also works well with chips and a green salad.</li>

<li>Lettuce leaves</li>
<li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
<li>1/2 tsp curry powder</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cook kumara in boiling salted water for about 10 minutes or until soft. Drain well, tiop back into pot and place over low heat for a few minutes to dry off.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large fry pan on medium-high heat. Cook mushroomes and onion, with a good pinch of salt for 6-8 minutes or until soft and all moisture in the pan (from the mushrooms) has evaporated. Add another drizzle of oil, garlic, curry powder, cumin, and lemon zest and continue cooking for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Add mushroom and onion mixture to the pot with the kumara, along with chickpeas, breadcrumbs, egg, salt, and herbs. Use a potato masher to mash everything together and season with pepper.</li>
<li>Divide and roll mixture into 6 large balls (about 3/4 cup each). Flatten and shape each ball into patties 1.5cm thick. Place in the fridge to firm up while you prepare everything else.</li>
<li>Oil each patty and cook on BBQ hotplate or large frying pan over medium-high heat for a few minutes each side until golden and cooked through. If using, drizzle portobello mushrooms and eggplant slices with oil, season, and cook until soft and golden.</li>
<li>Top each patty with cheese and melt under the grill, if desired. Lightly toast burger buns.</li>
<li>To assemble burgers, spread bottom hald with relish, top with pickles, a patty and cheese, eggplant/mushroom (if using), tomato, onion, and lettuce. Mix mayo and curry powder together and spread on top half of bun.</li>

<h2>Steak and Chips</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Lots of people don&#x27;t know how to cook steak, and just chuck it on the BBQ with no seasoning. I cooked steak for some of my friends using this method some of my friends said it was the best steak they&#x27;d ever had.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 40 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Steak and Chips</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 big scotch fillet steaks (aim for 125g per person)</li>
<li>1 kg potatoes (for chips)</li>
<li>1 bunch green vegetables (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mushroom Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li>200g sliced mushrooms</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/2 cup cream</li>
</ul>
<h4>Chimmichurri Sauce</h4>

<li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped (or other leafy green herbs)</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
</ul>
<h4>Plum Sauce</h4>
<ul>
<li>I use my mum&#x27;s plum sauce.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 220°C (428°F).</li>
<li>Cut the potatoes into chips and soak them in water for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Drain and pat the potatoes dry, then toss with oil and seasonings.</li>
<li>Spread the chips on a baking tray and bake for 30-40 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, season the steaks with salt and pepper and cook them in a hot pan for 3-4 minutes each side for medium-rare.</li>
<li>Serve the steaks with the chips and your choice of sauce.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>The key to cooking steak is to firstly let it come to room temperature before cooking, secondly to season it with salt 5 minutes before cooking, and thirdly to let it rest for 5 minutes after cooking.</li>
<li>Easier than making chips, we often just roast chopped potatoes.</li>
<li>You can use other cuts of steak, but scotch fillet is my favourite.</li>

<h2>Chicken &amp; Leek Pasties</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">The pastry from this recipe is amazing BTW. I used it to make beef wellingtons for some friends once and they were dreaming about the pastry months later. If there&#x27;s anything you take from this recipe, it&#x27;s the pastry!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 25 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4 (4 pasties)</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Rough puff pastry</h4>
<ul>
<li>300g plain flour</li>
<li>A pinch of sea salt</li>
<li>150g chilled unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filling</h4>
<ul>
<li>25g butter</li>
<li>2-3 medium leeks (about 500g), trimmed and finely sliced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon roughly chopped thyme leaves</li>
<li>150ml double cream</li>
<li>1 teaspoon English mustard</li>
<li>About 400g boned chicken thigh and breast meat (or leftover cooked chicken), cut into thick slices</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rapeseed or olive oil (if using fresh chicken)</li>
<li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h4>To finish</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 medium egg, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon milk, for glazing</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt, then add the cubed butter and toss until the pieces are coated with flour. Add just enough iced water (8-10 tablespoons) to bring the mixture together into a fairly firm dough.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into a rectangle with your hands and, on a well-floured surface, roll it out in one direction, away from you, so you end up with a rectangle about 1cm thick. Fold the far third towards you, then fold the nearest third over that (rather like folding a business letter), so that you now have a rectangle made up of 3 equal layers. Give the pastry a quarter-turn, then repeat the rolling, folding and turning process 5 more times. Wrap the pastry in a wax wrap or baking paper and rest it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, or up to an hour.</li>
<li>To make the filling, melt the butter in a frying pan, add the leeks and thyme, and sweat gently for 5-10 minutes, until the leeks are very tender. Stir in the cream and cook gently for 4-5 minutes to reduce and thicken. Stir in the mustard, season well and leave to cool.</li>
<li>If using fresh chicken, season well and fry in the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until evenly browned and cooked through, then leave to cool.</li>
<li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to about 3mm thick. Using a plate or a cake tin as a template, cut out four 20cm circles; you may have to gather up the trimmings, lay them on top of each other, and re-roll them to get your fourth circle.</li>
<li>Spoon the leek mixture on to one half of each circle and pile the chicken on top. Brush the pastry edges with a little water, fold the other half of the pastry over the filling to form a half-moon shape and crimp well to seal.</li>
<li>Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the tops of the pasties with beaten egg. Bake in an oven preheated to 190°C/Gas Mark 5 for about 25 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Eat hot or cold.</li>

<li>1/4 teaspoon honey</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a cold medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and the black pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes or until aromatic, but before the garlic browns. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes. Add 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. Once the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead the dough 10 to 15 times until smooth. Transfer to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. (It’s best to let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen).</li>
<li>After 1 hour, heat oven to 450°F (230°C). Use two tablespoons of the remaining garlic-olive oil mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tablespoons of the garlic-olive oil mixture. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly.</li>
<li>Bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia bread on a wire rack.</li>

<h2>British Pancakes</h2>

<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rest pancake batter for 20 minutes and you&#x27;ll get a lighter pancake.</li>
<li>Always weigh out your ingredients. Too much flour and not enough milk will result in a dense pancake.</li>
<li>When frying, use an equal mix of butter and oil - using just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. The butter helps with flavour and the oil stops the butter from burning.</li>
<li>Flip your pancake when the edges look set and dry.</li>
<li>And only flip your pancake once - otherwise it will be tough.</li>
<li>Don&#x27;t worry if the first pancake doesn&#x27;t come out right - use it to test the temperature of the pan and adjust accordingly.</li>

<h2>Self-saucing Chocolate Pudding</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Growing up, Aunty Barbara&#x27;s self-saucing chocolate pudding was a family favourite. This recipe is very similar, but with less sugar and more cocoa powder!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 35 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 4</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Pudding</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 cup self raising flour (150g)</li>

<li>80g butter, melted and cooled</li>

<li>2 Tbsp cocoa powder, sifted</li>
<li>1 ¼ cups boiling water (313ml)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180°C bake (160°C fan-forced). Grease a 6-cup capacity ovenproof baking dish.</li>
<li>Sift self raising flour and cocoa into a large bowl. Stir in the brown sugar.</li>
<li>Whisk butter, milk and egg in a jug. Slowly add to flour mixture, stirring until well combined and smooth. Spoon into baking dish and smooth the top.</li>
<li>For the sauce combine the brown sugar and cocoa and sprinkle over the pudding. Slowly pour the boiling water over the back of a large metal spoon to cover pudding. Place dish onto a baking tray and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until pudding bounces back when pressed gently in the centre.</li>
<li>Serve hot with vanilla ice cream or cream.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>A dry self saucing pudding usually means it was overbaked or didn&#x27;t have enough boiling water added. To keep it saucy, measure liquids carefully and bake until the sponge is just set. Don&#x27;t overcook!</li>
<li>You can prepare the batter and topping ahead of time, but it&#x27;s best to bake self saucing pudding just before serving. Add the hot water and bake fresh so the sauce stays warm and gooey.</li>

<li>Prepare a double boiler by bringing a few centimetres of water to a simmer in a saucepan. Place a glass or stainless steel bowl over the top, so that it fits snugly without touching the water below.</li>

<li>4 eggs, separated (Size 7)</li>
<li>10ml vanilla essence</li>
<li>Ground cinnamon, to sprinkle</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a 25cm pie dish with grease spray.</li>
<li>For the smear crust: Cream 100g softened salted butter and 100g granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Add 2 eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Fold in 100g plain flour until the mixture is well combined.</li>
<li>Using your fingers, smear a very thin, even layer of the mixture over the base and sides of the prepared pie dish. Use a light touch so the mixture distributes evenly; this forms a delicate thin crust. If you have extra mixture, freeze for later use.</li>
<li>For the filling: Preheat the oven to 160°C (fan or conventional equivalent). Put 600ml milk into a pot and warm over medium-low heat until scalding (just below boiling).</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 150ml milk, 150g granulated sugar, 50g plain flour, 50g cornflour and 2g salt into a smooth, lump-free paste.</li>
<li>While stirring, gradually add the hot scalded milk to the paste to temper it, then return the combined mixture to the pot. Heat over medium-low, stirring continuously, until the mixture reaches its first boil and forms a thick plop (bubbles).</li>
<li>Transfer the hot milk mixture to a mixing bowl. Lightly whisk the 4 egg yolks and whisk them into the warm milk mixture. Add 100g salted butter and 10ml vanilla essence and stir until combined; the butter will melt into the warm custard. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
<li>In a clean bowl, whip the 4 egg whites to stiff peaks (but not dry).</li>
<li>Once the milk mixture has cooled to warm (not hot), fold the whipped egg whites gently into the milk mixture until just combined.</li>
<li>Pour the filling gently into the prepared smear crust, smoothing the top. Sprinkle generously with ground cinnamon.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until the top is set and slightly golden.</li>
<li>Serve warm from the oven or chilled from the fridge (many prefer chilled).</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>All eggs used in this recipe are Size 7 (large).</li>
<li>The smear crust recipe may give extra; leftover crust freezes well.</li>
<li>Store milk tart in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.</li>

<li>Wet your hands and roll into good even sized balls which can be weighed if desired or done by sight. The most important thing to remember is to be light with the rolling, quick with hands and even in size.</li>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your hands are wet when rolling the scones. Run your hands under the tap every second scone.</li>
<li>Tasty cheese works well for this recipe, but you can also use up any cheese you have on hand.</li>
<li>Unlikely many recipes, this recipe actually works best if you use pre-grated cheese.</li>
<li>Smoked paprika can be used instead of cayenne pepper.</li>
<li>Chopped herbs can be added for extra flavour, such as parsley or chives.</li>

<h2>No Knead Bread</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">For when not making sourdough, this is my favourite bread recipe. It tastes great for a non-sourdough recipe.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 5 minutes + 3 hours rising | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 45 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 1 loaf</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 cups high grade flour (450g)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
<li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups very warm water (375ml)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Mix the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl, then add the water and stir. The dough should be very sticky.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for 3 hours.</li>
<li>After 3 hours, the dough should be bubbly and doubled in size.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 220°C fan-forced and place a Dutch oven (with lid) inside to heat up.</li>
<li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and fold in each of the sides, then flip upside down onto a sheet of baking paper.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven and place the dough inside.</li>
<li>Cover with the lid and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the lid and bake for an additional 15 minutes, until the bread is golden brown.</li>
<li>Let cool before slicing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t bother preheating the Dutch oven. I just put the dough in and it works fine.</li>
<li>If using normal bread yeast, dissolve the yeast in the water first.</li>

<h2>Feijoa Chutney</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">This is the recipe which mum uses to make feijoa chutney. It&#x27;s one of my favourites to eat on toast with swiss cheese. Kimmie hates it!</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 30 minutes | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 3 hours | <strong>Servings:</strong> 8-10 jars</div>

<li>Place all ingredients in large pot and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally towards the end, until mixture is thick and brown (up to 3 hours).</li>

<li>Keeps for months.</li>
<li>Refrigerate once open.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>A great way to use up excess feijoas!</li>
<li>Some feijoa varieties are much sweeter and juicier than others, so your chutney may vary from one batch to the next. We have reduced the vinegar in this recipe from 1 litre to 750ml, but you may wish to try it after it has cooked for an hour and adjust the flavour balance to suit your taste.</li>
<li>The cooking time will vary depending on the juiciness of your feijoas and the size of your pot. If you are making a double batch it will take even longer to reduce.</li>

<h2>Greek Yoghurt (EasiYo)</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Economical, thick, and creamy Greek yoghurt using EasiYo base and extra milk powder. No straining, no thickeners, no preservatives.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 5 minutes (plus 24 hours incubation) | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 0 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> Makes 1kg</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cold tap water</li>
<li>180g full-cream milk powder</li>
<li>3 tbsp greek yoghurt (or 3 tbsp of plain EasiYo Greek yoghurt sachet)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Gather all ingredients and boil the kettle.</li>
<li>In the yoghurt making canister, fill to the halfway mark with cold water. Add the yoghurt starter.</li>
<li>Add the milk powder.</li>
<li>Place the lid on and shake vigorously until the milk powder is dissolved. Remove the lid and fill to the fill line with more water. Screw the lid on tightly and shake again.</li>
<li>Fill the EasiYo yoghurt maker to the fill line with boiling water.</li>
<li>Place the canister inside and screw on the yoghurt maker lid. Leave for 24 hours. Remove and refrigerate. Keeps for seven days.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>EasiYo real base and culture is intended for you to use the entire sachet for a batch of yoghurt but using just 2-3 tablespoons is enough if you add extra milk powder. This makes it a lot cheaper.</li>
<li>Store the remainder of the opened base sachet in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>You can use 3 tablespoons from the previous batch of yoghurt as a starter for your next batch.</li>
<li>For sweetened yoghurt, add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar to the canister when mixing in the milk powder and starter.</li>
<li>Some people are happy with yoghurt cultured for 12-14 hours, but 24 hours gives a thick and creamy consistency.</li>
<li>If you don&#x27;t have an EasiYo, you can use a slow cooker: preheat on low for 30 minutes, turn off, fill with boiling water, place your sealed container with the mixture inside, and incubate as above.</li>
<li>Adjust the amount of milk powder to get your desired thickness. More milk powder = thicker yoghurt.</li>

<h2>Yorkshire Puddings</h2>
<blockquote class="commentary">Classic British side, crisp and hollow, perfect for roast dinners.</blockquote>
<div class="meta"><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 35 minutes (including resting) | <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 15-25 minutes | <strong>Servings:</strong> 12 standard muffin sized puddings</div>
<div class="columns">
<div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 large eggs</li>
<li>150g all-purpose flour</li>
<li>175g whole milk</li>
<li>25g water</li>
<li>2g kosher salt (about 1/2 teaspoon)</li>
<li>100ml beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="instructions"><h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For best results, refrigerate batter overnight or up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while preheating oven.</li>
<li>Adjust oven rack to centre position and preheat oven to 230°C. Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins, one 12-well standard muffin tin, or one 24-well mini muffin tin. Preheat in oven until fat is smoking hot, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer pans or tins to a heat-proof surface and divide batter evenly between every well (or between pans if using pans). Wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (or 1/4 for pans). Immediately return to oven. Bake until puddings have quadrupled in volume, are deep brown, crisp, and sound hollow when tapped. Smaller ones take about 15 minutes, popover/skillet-sized about 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="notes"><h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resting the batter overnight improves results.</li>
<li>Can use beef drippings, lard, shortening, or vegetable oil.</li>
<li>For best rise, ensure fat is smoking hot before adding batter.</li>
